While a huge increase in the supply of <em>quality</em> premium themes hasn’t particularly driven down prices, it has promoted <strong>a huge push for innovation</strong>, best practices and quality design.</p>\n<p>Unfortunately, there’s one crucial thing which rarely gets quite so much attention as the <em>must have responsive design</em>: after-sales support. Sadly, all too often, documentation is seriously lacking, and getting a reply on the developer’s support forum or via email takes much longer than it should. This post aims to <strong>take the pain out</strong> of using a premium WordPress theme by sharing some tips I’ve learned in my time as a “support expert” for a major theme shop.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://media.smashingmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/10/jNyJd.jpg\"><img title=\"It’s easy to fall for beautifully-designed WordPress themes, but there’s more to look for than just design.\" src=\"http://media.smashingmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/10/jNyJd.jpg\" alt=\"It’s easy to fall for beautifully-designed WordPress themes, but when choosing the right one for your website, there’s more to look for than just design.\" width=\"550\" height=\"289\"></a><br><em>It’s easy to fall for beautifully-designed WordPress themes, but when choosing the right one for your website, there’s more to look for than just design.</em></p>\n<p>We’re going to explore the steps you need to follow in order to get the most out of your premium WordPress theme — from simply choosing the right theme, to installing it <em>the right way</em>, to being able to ask support questions that get answered promptly, to making customizations to your theme which won’t get overwritten by theme updates. I should note there are plenty of excellent free WordPress themes available, but this post is aimed at paid — or “premium” — WordPress themes, as support for these themes is usually more comprehensive.</p>\n<h3>Before You Buy</h3>\n<p>It may sound obvious, but the whole process starts before you’ve even purchased your theme. It’s paramount you ensure that the theme you purchase is <em>absolutely right</em> for your website. There are thousands and thousands of themes available for you to choose from, so <strong>if you’re not sure, it’s probably not the one for you</strong>. By all means use the huge “theme galleries” you can find via Google, but just be wary that these galleries are often driven by affiliate sales, so take any “reviews” you read there with a pinch of salt. There are a number of reputable places to look for themes; here are a few:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"http://wordpress.org/extend/themes/commercial/\">WordPress.org’s Commercial Theme Gallery</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"http://wp.smashingmagazine.com/2011/04/20/detailed-comparison-of-premium-wordpress-theme-clubs/\">Smashing Magazine’s review of commercial theme clubs</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"http://wp.smashingmagazine.com/2012/05/23/best-wordpress-themes-newspapers/\">Smashing Magazine’s roundup of newspaper themes</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"http://www.noupe.com/design/a-collection-of-great-new-wordpress-themes.html\">Noupe’s collection of WordPress themes</a></li>\n</ul>\n<p>If you’ve got colleagues and friends who use WordPress, or even if you just see a website you like running WordPress with a premium theme, contact them and ask if they’d recommend the provider they use. Personal recommendations here can be very helpful.</p>\n<p>The design of your website is a huge thing, so take your time over the decision of which theme to go with. Draw up a shortlist and send it to friends and family — ideally who are readers — and see which they think would best suit your website. Theme shops often offer free “bonus themes” with a single purchase, so if you’re undecided between more than one theme from the same provider, you can try both on your website and see which you prefer.</p>\n<p>Themes often sell themselves as offering “great SEO,” but as long as your theme isn’t coded horrendously, Google is clever enough to be able to get to your content. A theme offering SEO as a selling point is only likely to <a href=\"http://wpshout.com/wordpress-seo-tips/\">offer marginal SEO gains, if any</a>. The majority of themes <em>will</em> be well-coded, and <strong>the warning signs for poor code</strong> can often be found without even looking at code that you don’t really understand. If the theme ticks all the checks we’re running through, you’re likely to be okay.</p>\n<p>If you’re unsure about the quality of a theme on your shortlist, often a quick Google search for “<em>theme name</em> not working” will reveal whether others have had problems. If nothing comes up in your search — great. If something does, look to see if the problems were fixed and how quickly, details which can help you make an informed decision about which theme to go for.</p>\n<h4>Test With the Demos</h4>\n<p>We’re not quite done with the theme choosing process yet, though. Theme demos are an invaluable resource for the prospective purchaser. These let you see exactly how the theme works on a real website. See what browsers the theme supports and if the theme is “responsive” — if visiting the demo on a tablet or smartphone results in an optimized version of the website being shown.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://media.smashingmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/10/hm63B.jpg\"><img title=\"WooThemes offers demos of all their themes, including an option to try out different preset color schemes.\" src=\"http://media.smashingmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/10/hm63B.jpg\" alt=\"WooThemes offers demos of all their themes, including an option to try out different preset color schemes.\" width=\"500\" height=\"316\"></a><br><em><a title=\"\" href=\"http://woothemes.com\">WooThemes</a> offers demos of all their themes, including an option to try out different preset color schemes.</em></p>\n<p>Don’t take any features for granted or assume that something you’ve seen in a different theme is included as standard. Look carefully for what features are there — but more crucially, which aren’t. Support teams often have a policy of not helping to include “extra” features that aren’t shown in the demo. Keep in mind that if it <em>looks</em> complicated, then sadly it probably <em>is</em>, and so will take you longer to set up.</p>\n<p>If you’re unsure about anything, then just ask. Contact details should be easy to find and a quick response to your query here is a good sign that any support requests you need to make later will be handled promptly. Some companies add links to their documentation from their demos, so, if possible, <strong>view the documentation</strong> <em>before</em> you purchase your theme, in order to gauge its quality. If there’s a support forum you can access, then definitely check it out and see what the quality of support is like. It doesn’t need to be an extensive look-through, just look to see if posts are answered promptly, customers are happy with the replies and there aren’t huge numbers of tickets about the same topics.</p>\n<h3>The Install</h3>\n<p>Once you’ve taken the big step and purchased your theme, the very first thing to do is to find the theme’s documentation and read the whole thing, from start to finish. No matter how experienced you are with themes, it’s vitally important you at least have a flick through the documentation: <strong>knowing the details</strong> here could save wasting time later on. The documentation should be either in the zipped file you downloaded with your purchase or in the support section of the theme shop’s website.</p>\n<p>Larger theme shops often have screencasts and extra bits of documentation available on their websites, so it’s worth taking some extra time to look for these — it’s often the generic tutorials that fix common problems.</p>\n<h4>Test First, Fix First</h4>\n<p>One of the most frequent starts to a support ticket is “<em>I’ve just installed the theme, this isn’t working. Please help! I can’t let visitors see the website like this!</em>” The short answer to that is — don’t. Don’t be in a situation where you’re pushing your new theme live and things aren’t working. How? Simple: <strong>test out the theme before showing it to visitors</strong>, and if anything isn’t working right, make sure it gets fixed there and then.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://media.smashingmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/10/jqneA.jpg\"><img title=\"The Theme Test Drive plugin allows you to try out all of the features of your new theme without showing it to visitors.\" src=\"http://media.smashingmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/10/jqneA.jpg\" alt=\"The Theme Test Drive plugin allows you to try out all of the features of your new theme without showing it to visitors.\" width=\"483\" height=\"265\"></a><br><em>The Theme Test Drive plugin allows you to try out all of the features of your new theme without showing it to visitors.</em></p>\n<p>Whether you want to do this locally or on your live website or by using a theme tester plugin (rather than just WordPress’s Live Preview feature, which doesn’t give access to the rest of the Dashboard) is up to you, but for ease of use, I’d recommend a theme testing plugin such as <a href=\"http://wordpress.org/extend/plugins/theme-test-drive/\">Theme Test Drive</a> or <a href=\"http://wordpress.org/extend/plugins/theme-preview/\">Theme Preview</a>. You might also want to use <a href=\"http://wordpress.org/extend/plugins/sucuri-scanner/\">Sucuri’s Site Scanner</a> just to check that there’s nothing malicious in your new upload.</p>\n<p>With your new theme active in a test environment, go back to the documentation and make sure you follow all of the instructions on setting up the new theme. This might include going to a special theme options page and entering some information, setting up menus using WordPress’s Menu feature or setting up some custom widgets included in the theme. If you do find something wrong and can’t find any mention of your problem in the documentation, then it’s time to head to the support center. If not, you’re good to go.</p>\n<h3>Getting Help: Using The Support Center</h3>\n<p>When you buy a theme, especially if it’s your first time buying one, it’s likely you’ll eventually need the help of your theme shop’s support center. This will most likely take the form of a support forum, but it could also be done via email or a help desk. Sadly, the quality of support varies widely, but there are things you can do to minimize the number of trips you have to make to the forum and ensure that your request is answered promptly.</p>\n<h4>Pre-Support Checks</h4>\n<p><a href=\"http://media.smashingmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/10/vLFut.jpg\"><img title=\"WordPress’s one-click updates mean there is no excuse to be running an out-of-date version!\" src=\"http://media.smashingmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/10/vLFut.jpg\" alt=\"WordPress’s one-click updates mean there is no excuse to be running an out-of-date version!\" width=\"542\" height=\"207\"></a><br><em>WordPress’s one-click updates mean there is no excuse to be running an out-of-date version!</em></p>\n<p>Whatever your problem, there are a few things you can do before you get to the support center. These three things will solve a lot of day-to-day problems:</p>\n<p><strong>Make sure you’re running the latest version of WordPress.</strong> You can find out if you’ve got the latest version by logging into your WordPress Dashboard. If there’s an update message (“nag”) running across the top of the screen, you need to update. WordPress can guide you through this process with its automatic updates.</p>\n<p><strong>Make sure you’ve got the latest version of your theme.</strong> The first thing to do here is to check which version of the theme you have installed. You can also do this from the Dashboard, by clicking on “Appearance.” You’ll see your theme at the top, and then a version number. Make a note of that number. If your theme supports automatic updates, you’ll be notified of any new versions and you will be able to update in a similar way as WordPress updates.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://media.smashingmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/10/zUpmN.jpg\"><img title=\"An update nag for one of WPZOOM’s themes.\" src=\"http://media.smashingmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/10/zUpmN.jpg\" alt=\"An update nag for one of WPZOOM’s themes.\" width=\"550\" height=\"130\"></a><br><em>An “update nag” for one of <a href=\"http://wpzoom.com\">WPZOOM</a>’s themes.</em></p>\n<p>If there’s no update nag and you’re not sure if you have automatic updates, you’ll now need to go back over to your theme shop’s website and hunt around for theme updates and a change log. Ideally, you’ll find these in some sort of “Members’ Area,” but they might just be listed on the theme’s main page. If the latest download of the theme is a newer version than the one you’ve got running on your website, you’ll need to update. There should be instructions how to do this either in the original documentation or readily available on the shop’s website.</p>\n<p><strong>Check for any plugin conflicts.</strong> This is the most common issue. It’s impossible for theme developers to support <em>all</em> WordPress plugins, so inevitably some will conflict with your theme. Before you post <em>anything</em> in a support center, do a plugin compatibility test: disable your plugins one by one to see if that solves your issue. This isn’t at all ideal, but it’s sadly a frequent problem, especially on themes with lots of jQuery.</p>\n<p>Being logical with which plugins you disable first should make this a smoother process, though. Start with anything you’ve enabled recently, around the time you noticed the problem starting. If that doesn’t solve the problem, next go for any plugins that use jQuery. These are likely to be the ones adding sliders or photo galleries, and they are often the culprits — especially the poorly-written ones (not to say that all plugins using jQuery are poorly written).</p>\n<p>If that <em>still</em> doesn’t solve the problem, go through non-essential plugins, with non-essential being things like “share boxes,” related posts and affiliate plugins.</p>\n<p>If the problem persists, head to the support center. Popular caching, SEO and anti-spam plugins are unlikely to be the source of any issues, although they can’t be ruled out.</p>\n<p>And finally, this won’t apply to all themes, but if support is provided via a forum, do a search beforehand! If your problem has been solved before, then this will get you an immediate answer.</p>\n<h4>Contacting the Support Team</h4>\n<p>With the pre-support checks complete, you’re now ready to contact your theme shop’s support team. Whether this is on a forum, by email or help desk, there are again some standard procedures that will ensure you get a prompt response.</p>\n<p>Before you start outlining your problem, list very clearly three things: your WordPress version, your theme version and your website URL. As the first two are already up-to-date, these won’t be an issue, but a link to your website is vital. If your website is behind a “coming soon” page, temporarily disable it; if the person trying to help you can’t see your website, it’s likely they won’t be able to help you.</p>\n<p>Now you’re ready to outline your problem. <strong>Do so as clearly and in as much detail as possible.</strong> Say your problem is with the comments section looking odd after updating to the latest version of the theme. Just saying “the comments look messed up” is not at all helpful; saying “I just updated to the latest version and now the comments section looks badly aligned” is much more helpful. If you’ve already checked for plugin conflicts, mention that too. If you’re not sure how to describe your problem, take a screenshot and mark on it what it is that’s wrong.</p>\n<p>All these steps will ensure that the person answering your request doesn’t have to spend time asking you for further details, so they can get straight into answering your request. Once you’ve posted your request, wait at least 48 hours before posting a follow up. Be persistent, but not annoying — repeatedly posting at two in the morning on a Sunday is <em>not</em> going to get your request answered any faster; be aware that support teams are people, too.</p>\n<p>If you find the support center unable to help, there are still a number of places you can go for help. <a href=\"http://www.wpquestions.com/\">WPQuestions</a>, for example, is a dedicated support board, as is <a href=\"http://wordpress.stackexchange.com/\">WordPress Answers</a> on Stack Exchange. WordPress.org also has <a href=\"http://wordpress.org/support/\">its own support forum</a>.</p>\n<p>If you find yourself in need of a freelancer to do more extensive work for you, companies often recommend people to work with, otherwise <a href=\"http://wpcandy.com/pros\">WPCandy’s directory of WordPress Pros</a> and job boards like <a href=\"http://jobs.smashingmagazine.com/\">Smashing Magazine’s job board</a> are good places to find people to help you.</p>\n<h3>Sustainable Customization</h3>\n<p>The final thing you might want to do with your brand new premium theme is customize it a little bit. Not huge changes; just little things like updating the color scheme and background so that it matches your branding, perhaps changing the layout slightly and adding some custom advertisements into areas like the header.</p>\n<h4>Built-In Customization Options</h4>\n<p><a href=\"http://media.smashingmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/10/Cgbx3.jpg\"><img title=\"An example theme’s customization options. Most themes have similar color customization options.\" src=\"http://media.smashingmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/10/Cgbx3.jpg\" alt=\"An example theme’s customization options. Most themes have similar color customization options.\" width=\"550\" height=\"283\"></a><br><em>An example theme’s customization options. Most themes have similar color customization options.</em></p>\n<p>It’s likely your theme will either have an “Options” panel from which it supports some limited customization or it will support WordPress’s built-in customization options, which have been made more extensive in version 3.4 of WordPress. It doesn’t matter which one your theme has, they’ll both be easy to use and the principle remains the same: they allow you to change limited aspects of your theme without writing any code at all.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://media.smashingmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/10/Nqlyj.jpg\"><img title=\"The Twenty Eleven Theme uses WordPress’s Customizer.\" src=\"http://media.smashingmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/10/Nqlyj.jpg\" alt=\"The Twenty Eleven Theme uses WordPress’s Customizer.\" width=\"301\" height=\"456\"></a><br><em>The Twenty Eleven Theme uses WordPress’s Customizer.</em></p>\n<p>You’ll find WordPress’s built in customization options under “Appearance,” and then the “Customize” button next to the screenshot of your theme. Otherwise, if your theme has any options, these will either be in a dedicated section of their own on the menu, or under “Appearance” and then “Theme Options.” Whichever your theme has, these should be well documented, so take a look at your documentation for details.</p>\n<h4>Sustainable Customizations</h4>\n<p>It’s likely you’ll very quickly find, though, that the built-in customization options are too limited and you want to make further changes. In order to do this, you’ll need to make code changes. Whether you learn how to do this yourself, ask in your support center or hire someone to do it for you, it’s absolutely vital that the changes that you make are <em>sustainable</em>. In practice, this just means that any changes you make aren’t going to be lost when you update your theme. Depending on which changes you want to make, there are two ways of doing this.</p>\n<p>The first is using a separate CSS file and loading it after your theme’s main file. Many themes have this already set up, as <code>custom.css</code>; the idea here is you can overwrite any styling in the theme’s original stylesheet, but in the event the stylesheet gets updated, you won’t lose any of your changes.</p>\n<p>If you want to make any further changes, though, in order to keep these sustainable, you’ll need to create what’s called a “child theme.” A child theme is a theme which shares all of the files of its “parent,” but can overwrite any of them by creating its own versions.</p>\n<p>So in its most basic form, a child theme starts with just a <code>style.css</code> file in an otherwise empty folder. Then if you want to make changes to, say, your header, adding in an ad section, you would duplicate the <code>header.php</code> file from your parent theme and then add the modified file to your child theme. This again means you won’t lose your changes when you update.</p>\n<p>There are a number of excellent tutorials on this topic, should you wish to learn further about child themes, including:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"http://www.studiopress.com/tutorials/building-child-themes\">Building Child Themes</a> by StudioPress</li>\n<li><a href=\"http://www.webdesignerdepot.com/2011/12/creating-your-first-wordpress-child-theme/\">Creating your first WordPress child theme </a> by WebDesignerDepot</li>\n<li><a href=\"http://wp.tutsplus.com/tutorials/theme-development/creating-a-simple-child-theme-using-twenty-eleven/\">Creating a Simple Child Theme Using Twenty Eleven</a> by WPTuts+</li>\n</ul>\n<p>It should be noted the child theme process is significantly different with theme frameworks, so you should follow tutorials specific to your framework to make sure you’re using child themes appropriately.</p>\n<h3>All Set Up</h3>\n<p>With your theme installed and set up properly, there are still some things you can do to make your WordPress experience easier. For example, you might like to follow some <a href=\"http://wpshout.com/first-steps-on-a-fresh-install/\">post-install tips</a> or <a href=\"http://digwp.com/2012/06/add-google-analytics-wordpress/\">set up Google Analytics</a>. With your theme properly set up, though, that’s the majority of the work done. After all — it’s the part of your website your visitors see! You might like to also write a post about your experience with using your theme so that others can refer to the information when deciding which theme to use.</p>\n<p>Hopefully this guide will be of some help to you when you next get started with a new WordPress theme. There’s a lot of information to take in, but most of it’s logical and the specifics can always be examined when you actually need them, rather than all at once. The main point to take home is do your research beforehand: with a well-designed, well-developed and well-supported theme, it’s very hard to go too far wrong.</p>\n<p><em>(cp)</em></p>\n<hr>\n<p><small>© Alex Denning for <a href=\"http://www.smashingmagazine.com\">Smashing Magazine</a>, 2013.</small></p>"

It is one of those apps that is an integral part in so many of our workflows. I for one feel naked and lost working on a Mac without it. Therefore, it should come as no surprise to hear that I was giddy with the news that <a href=\"http://v2.alfredapp.com\">version 2</a> will soon be knocking on our eager doors.</p>\n<p>In a recent <a href=\"http://blog.alfredapp.com/2012/12/05/alfred-v2-coming-soon/\">blog post</a>, Vero goes into a little detail, stating that version 2 has been secretly in the making for the past six months. The app has been rewritten from the ground up keeping very little of the original codebase and promises to be even more powerful, flexible and efficient. Vero also reassures Veteran users that they will still feel right at home in the new iteration of Alfred. Developers on the other hand, will have to tweak most of their existing extensions for them to work in the new version.</p>\n<p>Details are still a little sketchy at this time but the team behind Alfred has promised to tantalise our senses in the coming weeks with sneak peaks of the new features. A beta of the new version is slated to be available sometime in January 2013, but it will only be available to <a href=\"https://buy.alfredapp.com\">Mega Supporters</a>. If you haven’t yet bought a license then this would be the perfect time to do so, or alternatively you can <a href=\"https://buy.alfredapp.com/upgrade\">upgrade</a> your existing license and be part of all the fun when beta testing begins.</p>\n<p>In the mean time, why not peruse some of our previous coverage of Alfred, where we delve into ways of <a href=\"http://mac.appstorm.net/how-to/productivity-how-to/awaken-the-productivity-beast-in-alfred-part-1/\">making the best</a> of it, or turning it into a top notch <a href=\"http://mac.appstorm.net/how-to/utilities-how-to/turn-alfred-into-the-ultimate-notes-manager/\">Notes Manager</a>.</p>\n<div>\n<a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/MacAppStorm?a=ejr3LDRAJug:qnuXW03X88A:yIl2AUoC8zA\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/MacAppStorm?d=yIl2AUoC8zA\" border=\"0\"></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/MacAppStorm?a=ejr3LDRAJug:qnuXW03X88A:gIN9vFwOqvQ\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/MacAppStorm?i=ejr3LDRAJug:qnuXW03X88A:gIN9vFwOqvQ\" border=\"0\"></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/MacAppStorm?a=ejr3LDRAJug:qnuXW03X88A:V_sGLiPBpWU\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/MacAppStorm?i=ejr3LDRAJug:qnuXW03X88A:V_sGLiPBpWU\" border=\"0\"></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/MacAppStorm?a=ejr3LDRAJug:qnuXW03X88A:F7zBnMyn0Lo\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/MacAppStorm?i=ejr3LDRAJug:qnuXW03X88A:F7zBnMyn0Lo\" border=\"0\"></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/MacAppStorm?a=ejr3LDRAJug:qnuXW03X88A:D7DqB2pKExk\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/MacAppStorm?i=ejr3LDRAJug:qnuXW03X88A:D7DqB2pKExk\" border=\"0\"></a>\n</div><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/MacAppStorm/~4/ejr3LDRAJug\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\">"

It’s one of the top five books I’ve read in 2012. </em></p> <p style=\"text-align:center\">_________________________________</p> <blockquote><p><em>“One can have no smaller or greater mastery than mastery of oneself.”</em></p> <p>—Leonardo da Vinci</p></blockquote> <p>In the stories of the greatest Masters, past and present, we can inevitably detect a phase in their lives in which all of their future powers were in development, like the chrysalis of a butterfly. This part of their lives—a largely self-directed apprenticeship that lasts some five to ten years—receives little attention because it does not contain stories of great achievement or discovery. Often in their Apprenticeship Phase, these types are not yet much different from anyone else. Under the surface, however, their minds are transforming in ways we cannot see but contain all of the seeds of their future success.</p> <p>Much of how such Masters navigate this phase comes from an intuitive grasp of what is most important and essential for their development, but in studying what they did right we can learn some invaluable lessons for ourselves. In fact, a close examination of their lives reveals a pattern that transcends their various fields, indicating a kind of Ideal Apprenticeship for mastery. And to grasp this pattern, to follow it in our own ways, we must understand something about the very idea and necessity for passing through an apprenticeship.</p> <p>In childhood we are inculcated in culture through a long period of dependency—far longer than any other animal. During this period we learn language, writing, math, and reasoning skills, along with a few others. Much of this happens under the watchful and loving guidance of parents and teachers. As we get older, greater emphasis is placed on book learning—absorbing as much information as possible about various subjects. Such knowledge of history, science, or literature is abstract, and the process of learning largely involves passive absorption. At the end of this process (usually somewhere between the ages of eighteen and twenty-five) we are then thrust into the cold, harsh work world to fend for ourselves.</p> <p>When we emerge from the youthful state of dependency, we are not really ready to handle the transition to an entirely independent phase. We carry with us the habit of learning from books or teachers, which is largely unsuited for the practical, self-directed phase of life that comes next. We tend to be somewhat socially naïve and unprepared for the political games people play. Still uncertain as to our identity, we think that what matters in the work world is gaining attention and making friends. And these misconceptions and naïveté are brutally exposed in the light of the real world.</p> <p>If we adjust over time, we might eventually find our way; but if we make too many mistakes, we create endless problems for ourselves. We spend too much time entangled in emotional issues, and we never quite have enough detachment to reflect and learn from our experiences. The apprenticeship, by its very nature, must be conducted by each individual in his or her own way. To follow precisely the lead of others or advice from a book is self-defeating. This is the phase in life in which we finally declare our independence and establish who we are. But for this second education in our lives, so critical to our future success, there are some powerful and essential lessons that we all can benefit from, that can guide us away from common mistakes and save us valuable time.</p> <p>These lessons transcend all fields and historical periods because they are connected to something essential about human psychology and how the brain itself functions. They can be distilled into one overarching principle for the Apprenticeship Phase, and a process that loosely follows three steps.</p> <p>The principle is simple and must be engraved deeply in your mind: the goal of an apprenticeship is not money, a good position, a title, or a diploma, but rather the transformation of your mind and character—the first transformation on the way to mastery. You enter a career as an outsider. You are naïve and full of misconceptions about this new world. Your head is full of dreams and fantasies about the future. Your knowledge of the world is subjective, based on emotions, insecurities, and limited experience. Slowly, you will ground yourself in reality, in the objective world represented by the knowledge and skills that make people successful in it. You will learn how to work with others and handle criticism. In the process you will transform yourself from someone who is impatient and scattered into someone who is disciplined and focused, with a mind that can handle complexity. In the end, you will master yourself and all of your weaknesses.</p> <p>This has a simple consequence: you must choose places of work and positions that offer the greatest possibilities for learning. Practical knowledge is the ultimate commodity, and is what will pay you dividends for decades to come—far more than the paltry increase in pay you might receive at some seemingly lucrative position that offers fewer learning opportunities. This means that you move toward challenges that will toughen and improve you, where you will get the most objective feedback on your performance and progress. You do not choose apprenticeships that seem easy and comfortable.</p> <p>In this sense you must see yourself as following in the footsteps of Charles Darwin. You are finally on your own, on a voyage in which you will craft your own future. It is the time of youth and adventure—of exploring the world with an open mind and spirit. In fact, whenever you must learn a new skill or alter your career path later in life, you reconnect with that youthful, adventurous part of yourself. Darwin could have played it safe, collecting what was necessary, and spending more time on board studying instead of actively exploring. In that case, he would not have become an illustrious scientist, but just another collector. He constantly looked for challenges, pushing himself past his comfort zone. He used danger and difficulties as a way to measure his progress. You must adopt such a spirit and see your apprenticeship as a kind of journey in which you will transform yourself, rather than as a drab indoctrination into the work world.</p> <h3><span style=\"text-decoration:underline\"><strong>The Apprenticeship Phase—The Three Steps or Modes</strong></span></h3> <p>With the principle outlined above guiding you in your choices, you must think of three essential steps in your apprenticeship, each one overlapping the other. These steps are: Deep Observation (The Passive Mode), Skills Acquisition (The Practice Mode), and Experimentation (The Active Mode). Keep in mind that an apprenticeship can come in many different forms. It can happen at one place over several years, or it can consist of several different positions in different places, a kind of compound apprenticeship involving many different skills. It can include a mix of graduate school and practical experience. In all of these cases, it will help you to think in terms of these steps, although you may need to give added weight to a particular one depending on the nature of your field.</p> <h3><strong>Step One: Deep Observation—The Passive Mode</strong></h3> <div style=\"width:470px\"><img title=\"A-chalk-and-watercolour-d-007\" src=\"http://content.artofmanliness.com/uploads//2012/12/A-chalk-and-watercolour-d-007.jpeg\" alt=\"\" width=\"460\" height=\"276\"><p>Charles Darwin’s voyage on the Beagle is a perfect example of the Deep Observation step in the Apprenticeship Phase.</p></div> <p>When you enter a career or new environment, you move into a world with its own rules, procedures, and social dynamic. For decades or even centuries, people have compiled knowledge of how to get things done in a particular field, each generation improving on the past. In addition, every workplace has its own conventions, rules of behavior, and work standards. There are also all kinds of power relationships that exist between individuals. All of this represents a reality that transcends your individual needs and desires. And so your task upon entering this world is to observe and absorb its reality as deeply as possible.</p> <p>The greatest mistake you can make in the initial months of your apprenticeship is to imagine that you have to get attention, impress people, and prove yourself. These thoughts will dominate your mind and close it off from the reality around you. Any positive attention you receive is deceptive; it is not based on your skills or anything real, and it will turn against you. Instead, you will want to acknowledge the reality and submit to it, muting your colors and keeping in the background as much as possible, remaining passive and giving yourself the space to observe. You will also want to drop any preconceptions you might have about this world you are entering. If you impress people in these first months, it should be because of the seriousness of your desire to learn, not because you are trying to rise to the top before you are ready.</p> <p>You will be observing two essential realities in this new world. First, you will observe the rules and procedures that govern success in this environment—in other words, “this is how we do things here.” Some of these rules will be communicated to you directly—generally the ones that are superficial and largely a matter of common sense. You must pay attention to these and observe them, but what is of more interest are the rules that are unstated and are part of the underlying work culture. These concern style and values that are considered important. They are often a reflection of the character of the man or woman on top.</p> <p>You can observe such rules by looking at those who are on their way up in the hierarchy, who have a golden touch. More tellingly, you can observe those who are more awkward, who have been chastised for particular mistakes or even been fired. Such examples serve as negative trip wires: do things this way and you will suffer.</p> <p>The second reality you will observe is the power relationships that exist within the group: who has real control; through whom do all communications flow; who is on the rise and who is on the decline. These procedural and political rules may be dysfunctional or counterproductive, but your job is not to moralize about this or complain, but merely to understand them, to get a complete lay of the land. You are like an anthropologist studying an alien culture, attuned to all of its nuances and conventions. You are not there to change that culture; you will only end up being killed, or in the case of work, fired. Later, when you have attained power and mastery, you will be the one to rewrite or destroy these same rules.</p> <p>Every task you are given, no matter how menial, offers opportunities to observe this world at work. No detail about the people within it is too trivial. Everything you see or hear is a sign for you to decode. Over time, you will begin to see and understand more of the reality that eluded you at first. For instance, a person whom you initially thought had great power ended up being someone with more bark than bite. Slowly, you begin to see behind the appearances. As you amass more information about the rules and power dynamics of your new environment, you can begin to analyze why they exist, and how they relate to larger trends in the field. You move from observation to analysis, honing your reasoning skills, but only after months of careful attention.</p> <p>We can see how Charles Darwin followed this step quite clearly. By spending the first few months studying life on board the ship and perceiving the unwritten rules, he made his time for science much more productive. By enabling himself to fit in, he was able to avoid needless battles that would have later disrupted his scientific work, not to mention the emotional turmoil these would have presented to him. He later practiced the same technique with gauchos and other local communities he came in contact with. This allowed him to extend the regions he could explore and the specimens he could collect. On another level, he slowly transformed himself into perhaps the most astute observer of nature the world has ever known. Emptying himself of any preconceptions about life and its origins, Darwin trained himself to see things as they are. He did not theorize or generalize about what he was seeing until he had amassed enough information. Submitting to and absorbing the reality of all aspects of this voyage, he ended up piercing one of the most fundamental realities of all—the evolution of all living forms.</p> <p>Understand: there are several critical reasons why you must follow this step. First, knowing your environment inside and out will help you in navigating it and avoiding costly mistakes. You are like a hunter: your knowledge of every detail of the forest and of the ecosystem as a whole will give you many more options for survival and success. Second, the ability to observe any unfamiliar environment will become a critical lifelong skill. You will develop the habit of stilling your ego and looking outward instead of inward. You will see in any encounter what most people miss because they are thinking of themselves. You will cultivate a keen eye for human psychology, and strengthen your ability to focus. Finally, you will become accustomed to observing first, basing your ideas and theories on what you have seen with your eyes, and then analyzing what you find. This will be a very important skill for the next, creative phase in life.</p> <h3><strong>Step Two: Skills Acquisition—The Practice Mode</strong></h3> <p><img title=\"printerapprentice\" src=\"http://content.artofmanliness.com/uploads//2012/12/printerapprentice.jpeg\" alt=\"\" width=\"500\" height=\"403\"></p> <p>At some point, as you progress through the initial months of observation required in an apprenticeship, you will enter a critical stage: practice toward the acquisition of skills. Every human activity, endeavor, or career path involves the mastering of skills. In some fields, it is direct and obvious, like operating a tool or machine or creating something physical. In others, it is more of a mix of the physical and mental, such as the observing and collecting of specimens for Charles Darwin. In still others, the skills are more nebulous, such as handling people or researching and organizing information. As much as possible, you want to reduce these skills to something simple and essential—the core of what you need to get good at, skills that can be practiced.</p> <p>In acquiring any kind of skill, there exists a natural learning process that coincides with the functioning of our brains. This learning process leads to what we shall call tacit knowledge—a feeling for what you are doing that is hard to put into words but easy to demonstrate in action. And to understand how this learning process operates, it is useful to look at the greatest system ever invented for the training of skills and the achievement of tacit knowledge—the apprenticeship system of the Middle Ages. This system arose as a solution to a problem: As business expanded in the Middle Ages, Masters of various crafts could no longer depend on family members to work in the shop. They needed more hands. But it was not worth it for them to bring in people who would come and go—they needed stability and time to build up skills in their workers. And so they developed the apprenticeship system, in which young people from approximately the ages of twelve to seventeen would enter work in a shop, signing a contract that would commit them for the term of seven years. At the end of this term, apprentices would have to pass a master test, or produce a master work, to prove their level of skill. Once passed, they were now elevated to the rank of journeymen and could travel wherever there was work, practicing the craft.</p> <p>Because few books or drawings existed at the time, apprentices would learn the trade by watching Masters and imitating them as closely as possible. They learned through endless repetition and hands-on work, with very little verbal instruction (the word “apprentice” itself comes from the Latin <em>prehendere</em>, meaning to grasp with the hand). Because resources such as textiles, wood, and metals were expensive and could not be wasted on practice runs, apprentices would spend most of their time working directly on materials that would be used for the final product. They had to learn how to focus deeply on their work and not make mistakes.</p> <p>If one added up the time that apprentices ended up working directly on materials in those years, it would amount to more than 10,000 hours, enough to establish exceptional skill level at a craft. The power of this form of tacit knowledge is embodied in the great Gothic cathedrals of Europe—masterpieces of beauty, craftsmanship, and stability, all erected without blueprints or books. These cathedrals represented the accumulated skills of numerous craftsmen and engineers.</p> <p>What this means is simple: language, oral and written, is a relatively recent invention. Well before that time, our ancestors had to learn various skills—toolmaking, hunting, and so forth. The natural model for learning, largely based on the power of mirror neurons, came from watching and imitating others, then repeating the action over and over. Our brains are suited for this form of learning. In an activity such as riding a bicycle, we all know that it is easier to watch someone and follow their lead than to listen to or read instructions. The more we do it, the easier it becomes. Even with skills that are primarily mental, such as computer programming or speaking a foreign language, it remains the case that we learn best through practice and repetition—the natural learning process. We learn a foreign language by actually speaking it as much as possible, not by reading books and absorbing theories. The more we speak and practice, the more fluent we become.</p> <p>Once you take this far enough, you enter a cycle of accelerated returns in which the practice becomes easier and more interesting, leading to the ability to practice for longer hours, which increases your skill level, which in turn makes practice even more interesting. Reaching this cycle is the goal you must set for yourself, and to get there you must understand some basic principles about skills themselves.</p> <p>First, it is essential that you begin with one skill that you can master, and that serves as a foundation for acquiring others. You must avoid at all cost the idea that you can manage learning several skills at a time. You need to develop your powers of concentration, and understand that trying to multi task will be the death of the process.</p> <p>Second, the initial stages of learning a skill invariably involve tedium. Yet rather than avoiding this inevitable tedium, you must accept and embrace it. The pain and boredom we experience in the initial stage of learning a skill toughens our minds, much like physical exercise. Too many people believe that everything must be pleasurable in life, which makes them constantly search for distractions and short-circuits the learning process. The pain is a kind of challenge your mind presents—will you learn how to focus and move past the boredom, or like a child will you succumb to the need for immediate pleasure and distraction? Much as with physical exercise, you can even get a kind of perverse pleasure out of this pain, knowing the benefits it will bring you. In any event, you must meet any boredom head-on and not try to avoid or repress it. Throughout your life you will encounter tedious situations, and you must cultivate the ability to handle them with discipline.</p> <p>In practicing a skill in the initial stages, something happens neurologically to the brain that is important for you to understand. When you start something new, a large number of neurons in the frontal cortex (the higher, more conscious command area of the brain) are recruited and become active, helping you in the learning process. The brain has to deal with a large amount of new information, and this would be stressful and overwhelming if only a limited part of the brain were used to handle it. The frontal cortex even expands in size in this initial phase, as we focus hard on the task. But once something is repeated often enough, it becomes hardwired and automatic, and the neural pathways for this skill are delegated to other parts of the brain, farther down the cortex. Those neurons in the frontal cortex that we needed in the initial stages are now freed up to help in learning something else, and the area goes back to its normal size.</p> <p>In the end, an entire network of neurons is developed to remember this single task, which accounts for the fact that we can still ride a bicycle years after we first learned how to do so. If we were to take a look at the frontal cortex of those who have mastered something through repetition, it would be remarkably still and inactive as they performed the skill. All of their brain activity is occurring in areas that are lower down and require much less conscious control.</p> <p>This process of hardwiring cannot occur if you are constantly distracted, moving from one task to another. In such a case, the neural pathways dedicated to this skill never get established; what you learn is too tenuous to remain rooted in the brain. It is better to dedicate two or three hours of intense focus to a skill than to spend eight hours of diffused concentration on it. You want to be as immediately present to what you are doing as possible.</p> <p>Once an action becomes automatic, you now have the mental space to observe yourself as you practice. You must use this distance to take note of your weaknesses or flaws that need correction—to analyze yourself. It helps also to gain as much feedback as possible from others, to have standards against which you can measure your progress so that you are aware of how far you have to go. People who do not practice and learn new skills never gain a proper sense of proportion or self-criticism. They think they can achieve anything without effort and have little contact with reality. Trying something over and over again grounds you in reality, making you deeply aware of your inadequacies and of what you can accomplish with more work and effort.</p> <p>If you take this far enough, you will naturally enter the cycle of accelerated returns: As you learn and gain skills you can begin to vary what you do, finding nuances that you can develop in the work, so that it becomes more interesting. As elements become more automatic your mind is not exhausted by the effort and you can practice harder, which in turn brings greater skill and more pleasure. You can look for challenges, new areas to conquer, keeping your interest at a high level. As the cycle accelerates, you can reach a point where your mind is totally absorbed in the practice, entering a kind of flow in which everything else is blocked out. You become one with the tool or instrument or thing you are studying. Your skill is not something that can be put into words; it is embedded in your body and nervous system—it becomes tacit knowledge. Learning any kind of skill deeply prepares you for mastery. The sensation of flow and of being a part of the instrument is a precursor to the great pleasures that mastery can bring.</p> <p>In essence, when you practice and develop any skill you transform yourself in the process. You reveal to yourself new capabilities that were previously latent, that are exposed as you progress. You develop emotionally. Your sense of pleasure becomes redefined. What offers immediate pleasure comes to seem like a distraction, an empty entertainment to help pass the time. Real pleasure comes from overcoming challenges, feeling confidence in your abilities, gaining fluency in skills, and experiencing the power this brings. You develop patience. Boredom no longer signals the need for distraction, but rather the need for new challenges to conquer.</p> <p>Although it might seem that the time necessary to master the requisite skills and attain a level of expertise would depend on the field and your own talent level, those who have researched the subject repeatedly come up with the number of 10,000 hours. This seems to be the amount of quality practice time that is needed for someone to reach a high level of skill and it applies to composers, chess players, writers, and athletes, among others. This number has an almost magical or mystical resonance to it. It means that so much practice time—no matter the person or the field—leads to a qualitative change in the human brain. The mind has learned to organize and structure large amounts of information. With all of this tacit knowledge, it can now become creative and playful with it. Although the number of hours might seem high, it generally adds up to seven to ten years of sustained, solid practice—roughly the period of a traditional apprenticeship. In other words, concentrated practice over time cannot fail but produce results.</p> <h3><strong>Step Three: Experimentation—The Active Mode</strong></h3> <p><img title=\"scientist\" src=\"http://content.artofmanliness.com/uploads//2012/12/scientist.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"500\" height=\"261\"></p> <p>This is the shortest part of the process, but a critical component nonetheless. As you gain in skill and confidence, you must make the move to a more active mode of experimentation. This could mean taking on more responsibility, initiating a project of some sort, doing work that exposes you to the criticisms of peers or even the public. The point of this is to gauge your progress and whether there are still gaps in your knowledge. You are observing yourself in action and seeing how you respond to the judgments of others. Can you take criticism and use it constructively?</p> <p>With Charles Darwin, as the voyage progressed and he began to entertain the notions that would lead to his theory of evolution, he decided to expose his ideas to others. First, on the Beagle, he discussed them with the captain and patiently absorbed his vehement criticisms of the idea. This, Darwin told himself, would be more or less the reaction of the public, and he would have to prepare himself for that. He also began to write letters to various scientists and scientific societies back in England. The responses he received indicated he was on to something, but that he would need some more research. For Leonardo da Vinci, as he progressed in his studio work for Verrocchio, he began to experiment and to assert his own style. He found to his surprise that the Master was impressed with his inventiveness. For Leonardo, this indicated that he was near the end of his apprenticeship.</p> <p>Most people wait too long to take this step, generally out of fear. It is always easier to learn the rules and stay within your comfort zone. Often you must force yourself to initiate such actions or experiments before you think you are ready. You are testing your character, moving past your fears, and developing a sense of detachment to your work—looking at it through the eyes of others. You are getting a taste for the next phase in which what you produce will be under constant scrutiny.</p> <p>You will know when your apprenticeship is over by the feeling that you have nothing left to learn in this environment. It is time to declare your independence or move to another place to continue your apprenticeship and expand your skill base. Later in life, when you are confronted with a career change or the need to learn new skills, having gone through this process before, it will become second nature. You have learned how to learn.</p> <p style=\"text-align:center\">__________________</p> <p><em>To read more, check out <a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0670024961/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=0670024961&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;tag=stucosuccess-20\">Mastery</a> by Robert Greene.</em></p> <div> <p>Related posts:<ol> <li><a href=\"http://artofmanliness.com/2011/08/14/plateau-busting-how-to-take-your-life-to-the-next-level/\" rel=\"bookmark\" title=\"Plateau Busting: How to Take Your Life to the Next Level\">Plateau Busting: How to Take Your Life to the Next Level</a></li> <li><a href=\"http://artofmanliness.com/2012/04/16/how-to-tie-a-bow-tie-an-illustrated-guide/\" rel=\"bookmark\" title=\"How to Tie a Bow Tie: An Illustrated Guide\">How to Tie a Bow Tie: An Illustrated Guide</a></li> <li><a href=\"http://artofmanliness.com/2010/11/07/the-secret-of-great-men-deliberate-practice/\" rel=\"bookmark\" title=\"The Secret of Great Men: Deliberate Practice\">The Secret of Great Men: Deliberate Practice</a></li> <li><a href=\"http://artofmanliness.com/2008/06/08/7-vital-characteristics-of-a-man/\" rel=\"bookmark\" title=\"7 Vital Characteristics of a Man\">7 Vital Characteristics of a Man</a></li> <li><a href=\"http://artofmanliness.com/2009/05/20/so-you-want-my-job-film-director/\" rel=\"bookmark\" title=\"So You Want My Job: Film Director\">So You Want My Job: Film Director</a></li> </ol></p> <img src=\"http://yarpp.org/pixels/679ea311e567028f4b85da1b3beea77c\"> </div> <img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/TheArtOfManliness/~4/GT73uSrpwdQ\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\"><img width=\"1\" height=\"1\" src=\"http://artofmanliness.com.feedsportal.com/c/35087/f/648477/s/265f73de/mf.gif\" border=\"0\"><div><table border=\"0\"><tr><td valign=\"middle\"><a href=\"http://share.feedsportal.com/viral/sendEmail.cfm?lang=en&amp;title=Gaining+Mastery%3A+The+Three+Vital+Steps+of+the+Apprenticeship+Phase&amp;link=http%3A%2F%2Ffeedproxy.google.com%2F%7Er%2FTheArtOfManliness%2F%7E3%2FGT73uSrpwdQ%2F\"><img src=\"http://res3.feedsportal.com/images/emailthis2.gif\" border=\"0\"></a></td><td valign=\"middle\"><a href=\"http://res.feedsportal.com/viral/bookmark.cfm?title=Gaining+Mastery%3A+The+Three+Vital+Steps+of+the+Apprenticeship+Phase&amp;link=http%3A%2F%2Ffeedproxy.google.com%2F%7Er%2FTheArtOfManliness%2F%7E3%2FGT73uSrpwdQ%2F\"><img src=\"http://res3.feedsportal.com/images/bookmark.gif\" border=\"0\"></a></td></tr></table></div><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/TheArtOfManliness/~4/CVSq4VugY1k\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\"><img width=\"1\" height=\"1\" src=\"http://artofmanliness.com.feedsportal.com/c/35087/f/648477/s/265f73de/mf.gif\" border=\"0\"><div><table border=\"0\"><tr><td valign=\"middle\"><a href=\"http://share.feedsportal.com/viral/sendEmail.cfm?lang=en&amp;title=Gaining+Mastery%3A+The+Three+Vital+Steps+of+the+Apprenticeship+Phase&amp;link=http%3A%2F%2Ffeedproxy.google.com%2F%7Er%2FTheArtOfManliness%2F%7E3%2FCVSq4VugY1k%2Fstory01.htm\"><img src=\"http://res3.feedsportal.com/images/emailthis2.gif\" border=\"0\"></a></td><td valign=\"middle\"><a href=\"http://res.feedsportal.com/viral/bookmark.cfm?title=Gaining+Mastery%3A+The+Three+Vital+Steps+of+the+Apprenticeship+Phase&amp;link=http%3A%2F%2Ffeedproxy.google.com%2F%7Er%2FTheArtOfManliness%2F%7E3%2FCVSq4VugY1k%2Fstory01.htm\"><img src=\"http://res3.feedsportal.com/images/bookmark.gif\" border=\"0\"></a></td></tr></table></div><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/TheArtOfManliness/~4/cA2uJPL6o2Y\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\"><img width=\"1\" height=\"1\" src=\"http://artofmanliness.com.feedsportal.com/c/35087/f/648477/s/265f73de/mf.gif\" border=\"0\"><div><table border=\"0\"><tr><td valign=\"middle\"><a href=\"http://share.feedsportal.com/viral/sendEmail.cfm?lang=en&amp;title=Gaining+Mastery%3A+The+Three+Vital+Steps+of+the+Apprenticeship+Phase&amp;link=http%3A%2F%2Ffeedproxy.google.com%2F%7Er%2FTheArtOfManliness%2F%7E3%2FcA2uJPL6o2Y%2Fstory01.htm\"><img src=\"http://res3.feedsportal.com/images/emailthis2.gif\" border=\"0\"></a></td><td valign=\"middle\"><a href=\"http://res.feedsportal.com/viral/bookmark.cfm?title=Gaining+Mastery%3A+The+Three+Vital+Steps+of+the+Apprenticeship+Phase&amp;link=http%3A%2F%2Ffeedproxy.google.com%2F%7Er%2FTheArtOfManliness%2F%7E3%2FcA2uJPL6o2Y%2Fstory01.htm\"><img src=\"http://res3.feedsportal.com/images/bookmark.gif\" border=\"0\"></a></td></tr></table></div><br><br><a href=\"http://da.feedsportal.com/r/151884236723/u/49/f/648477/c/35087/s/265f73de/a2.htm\"><img src=\"http://da.feedsportal.com/r/151884236723/u/49/f/648477/c/35087/s/265f73de/a2.img\" border=\"0\"></a><img width=\"1\" height=\"1\" src=\"http://pi.feedsportal.com/r/151884236723/u/49/f/648477/c/35087/s/265f73de/a2t.img\" border=\"0\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/TheArtOfManliness/~4/YRMwyG9w-RA\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\">"

Apple's <a href=\"http://support.apple.com/kb/HT4889\">Migration Assistant</a> transfers information when you set up your new Mac, letting you retain all your preferences and passwords on your new system. You pick up one one machine where you left off on another.</p>\n<p>\n\tSo why do so many of us here at TUAW manually set up our computers? It's all about cruft, that stuff that builds up over time. Cruft includes apps you no longer use, preferences you don't really remember setting, bits and pieces scattered around your system that accumulate with use.</p>\n<p>\n\tWe love unboxing, smelling that captured Shenzhen air, and setting up from scratch instead of bringing all our old mistakes and history along with us. And quite a number of us do this whenever we upgrade.</p>\n<p>\n\tSure, it&#39;s a much harder process. I have a migration log that I use each time I set up a Mac. It takes at least a half day of work, waiting for applications to transfer, re-entering serial numbers, adjusting the way my scrollbars work (&quot;Show scrollbars: always, Mouse &gt; Scroll direction, natural: disable), and tweaking my hosts file (<a href=\"http://someonewhocares.org/hosts/\">someonewhocares.org</a>). And that's just a taste of the customization I do.</p>\n<p>\n\tManually setting up your system transforms an automatic act into a deliberate one. It provides an excellent opportunity to question historical choices and evaluate how you want your system to behave. It's a natural break point, where you can reconsider how you've designed key system elements and where you can try out new ones fresh.</p>\n<p>\n\tIt gives you a sense that your new computer really <em>is</em> new, complete with \"new car\" smell. You wouldn't want to move over all the crumb-infested juicebox-stained seats from your old minivan to your new Porsche, so why would you want to do the same for your Mac?</p>\n<p>\n\tAgreed, that's not a fair metaphor -- but it gives a sense of the ownership some of us want to feel over our new system. There's nothing there that we didn't deliberately put there. Sure, that sense of control quickly fades away as we start building up caches and attachment folders, temp files and so forth. But at least for a while, our system is fresh. And that's something worth considering the next time you upgrade.</p>\n<p>\n\tWhat about you? Are you a migrator or a manual installer?

After integrating with the iOS 6 service only a couple weeks ago, MLB is already seeing 12% of its e-ticket buyers opt for using digital passes on their iPhones.<span></span></p> <p>According to MarketWatch:</p> <blockquote><p>Passbook – which allows tickets and loyalty cards from a variety of outlets to be delivered to one iPhone app – proved to be an instant hit with fans, Bob Bowman, CEO of MLB Advance Media, tells MarketWatch. In its test run with four teams for the final two weeks of the season, 1,500 e-ticket buyers (12%) chose Passbook delivery. “That adoption rate really floored us – there is no question our fans want digital tickets,” Bowman says. “Fans can use the tickets, forward them to a friend, resell them, or even donate them to charity – and they never get lost or left at home.”</p></blockquote> <p>With the rise of Square and mobile payments, people are starting to prefer a digital wallet over a physical one. Last season, more than two thirds of MLB’s single-game seats were ordered as digital ticket stubs online. After Passbook starts to gain traction, MLB foresees printed ticket sales dropping below 10%.</p> <p>The future is almost here.</p> <p>Source: <a href=\"http://www.marketwatch.com/story/on-deck-for-2013-the-end-of-the-baseball-ticket-2012-10-09\">MarketWatch</a></p> <p>Image: <a href=\"http://blog.sfgate.com/techchron/2012/09/19/mlb-stubhub-fandango-jump-on-apples-mobile-ticket-plan/\">SFGate</a></p> <img width=\"1\" height=\"1\" src=\"http://cultofmac.com.feedsportal.com/c/33797/f/606249/s/244c5311/mf.gif\" border=\"0\"><div><p>Related Stories</p><ul><li><a href=\"http://cultofmac.com.feedsportal.com/c/33797/f/606249/s/2454c218/l/0L0Scultofmac0N0C19520A30Ccleartones0Eorganic0Ethe0Eleast0Eannoying0Eringtones0Ein0Ethe0Eworld0C/story01.htm\">Cleartones Organic, The Least Annoying Ringtones In The World</a></li><li><a href=\"http://cultofmac.com.feedsportal.com/c/33797/f/606249/s/2454cd06/l/0L0Scultofmac0N0C1952680Cangry0Ebirds0Eseries0Estill0Esees0Emore0Ethan0E20A0A0Emillion0Eactive0Eusers0Ea0Emonth0C/story01.htm\">Angry Birds Series Still Sees More Than 200 Million Active Users A Month</a></li><li><a href=\"http://cultofmac.com.feedsportal.com/c/33797/f/606249/s/2454cd10/l/0L0Scultofmac0N0C1952290Clacie0Eclaims0Efastest0Eportable0Ethunderbolt0Edrive0C/story01.htm\">Lacie Claims Fastest Portable Thunderbolt Drive</a></li><li><a href=\"http://cultofmac.com.feedsportal.com/c/33797/f/606249/s/2454d9f2/l/0L0Scultofmac0N0C1952390Ctodays0Ecamera0Ephones0Eare0Ebetter0Ethan0Ethe0Ecompacts0Eof0Efive0Eyears0Eago0C/story01.htm\">Today’s Camera Phones Are Better Than The Compacts Of Five Years Ago</a></li><li><a href=\"http://cultofmac.com.feedsportal.com/c/33797/f/606249/s/24552dc4/l/0L0Scultofmac0N0C1952910Csurvey0Esuggests0Emost0Eios0E60Eusers0Edont0Ehave0Ea0Eproblem0Ewith0Emaps0Eat0Eall0C/story01.htm\">Survey Suggests Most iOS 6 Users Don’t Have A Problem With Maps At All</a></li></ul></div><div><table border=\"0\"><tr><td valign=\"middle\"><a href=\"http://share.feedsportal.com/viral/sendEmail.cfm?lang=en&amp;title=MLB%3A+We+Want+To+Stop+Selling+Printed+Tickets%2C+And+Apple%E2%80%99s+Passbook+Is+Helping+Us+Get+There&amp;link=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.cultofmac.com%2F195153%2Fmlb-we-want-to-stop-selling-printed-tickets-and-apples-passbook-is-helping-us-get-there%2F\"><img src=\"http://res3.feedsportal.com/images/emailthis2.gif\" border=\"0\"></a></td><td valign=\"middle\"><a href=\"http://res.feedsportal.com/viral/bookmark.cfm?title=MLB%3A+We+Want+To+Stop+Selling+Printed+Tickets%2C+And+Apple%E2%80%99s+Passbook+Is+Helping+Us+Get+There&amp;link=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.cultofmac.com%2F195153%2Fmlb-we-want-to-stop-selling-printed-tickets-and-apples-passbook-is-helping-us-get-there%2F\"><img src=\"http://res3.feedsportal.com/images/bookmark.gif\" border=\"0\"></a></td></tr></table></div><br><br><a href=\"http://da.feedsportal.com/r/146820982495/u/94/f/606249/c/33797/s/244c5311/a2.htm\"><img src=\"http://da.feedsportal.com/r/146820982495/u/94/f/606249/c/33797/s/244c5311/a2.img\" border=\"0\"></a><img width=\"1\" height=\"1\" src=\"http://pi.feedsportal.com/r/146820982495/u/94/f/606249/c/33797/s/244c5311/a2t.img\" border=\"0\">"

But before they head out on their own and make their mark on the world, our kids need to learn how to be responsible, contributing members of the family household. Household chores are training exercises for real life. Chores not only teach children important life skills that will prepare them for living on their own, and impart a pull-your-own-weight work ethic, but recent studies show that starting chores at an early age gives children an enormous leg-up in other areas of their life as well.</p>\n<p>Unfortunately, very few children today are getting the training at home they need to become industrious, responsible adults. Studies show that children in the West spend little time helping around the house. While children a century or two ago were expected to do many things to keep the household running, especially if they lived on a farm, <a href=\"http://online.wsj.com/article/SB121978677837474177.html\">according to the Maryland Population Research Center</a>, today’s 6-12 year-old child spends only about 24 minutes a day doing chores. This represents a 25% drop even since 1981. When kids do help around the house, it’s frequently done under duress; parents often have to plead, bribe, and threaten to get their children to do basic things like taking out the trash or cleaning up after dinner.</p>\n<p>Anthropologists studying child-rearing across cultures <a href=\"http://www.psychologytoday.com/blog/benign-neglect/201102/talking-trash-or-taking-it-out\">have noted</a> that this “chore strike” by children is primarily a Western phenomenon. In developing societies, children are almost universally eager to help out and be useful. For example, in the remote Guarra settlement in Nepal, children as young as <span style=\"text-decoration:underline\">18 months </span>carry firewood and water. Young boys of the Nuer people of Southern Sudan and Western Ethiopia can be found herding sheep and goats without any cajoling from their parents. And infants in a community in Zaire are taught to use even “dangerous” tools like the machete with skill:</p>\n<div style=\"width:430px\"><img title=\"machete\" src=\"http://content.artofmanliness.com/uploads//2012/09/machete.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"420\" height=\"379\"><p>A page from <a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0195131339/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=0195131339&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;tag=stucosuccess-20\"><em>The Cultural Nature of Human Development</em></a></p></div>\n<p>The contributions of children in developing countries can be crucial to their family’s survival. But doing chores is still important for kids living in the suburbs of America; while their responsibilities may not be central to the livelihood of their households, they are essential in helping them grow up in an unselfish and well-adjusted way and shaping them into fully-functioning adults and contributing members of society.</p>\n<p>Last month we ran <a title=\"Heading Out on Your Own: 31 Life Skills in 31 Days — Series Wrap-Up\" href=\"http://artofmanliness.com/2012/09/01/heading-out-on-your-own-31-life-skills-in-31-days-series-wrap-up/\">a series on the basic life skills a young man would need to know as he headed out on his own</a> — they were the things I wish I had learned before leaving home. While it’s never too late to learn those skills, in an ideal world, you would master them as you grew up. So, unsurprising, writing that series got me interested in what I can do now as a dad to help my young son Gus grow into a more competent young man than I was. Below I share some of the benefits of giving your kids chores, as well as what we can do as fathers to get our kids to do the chores we assign them. (Along with some pictures of how we’ve incorporated these ideas in encouraging Gus’ desire to pitch in around the house).</p>\n<h3><strong>The Benefits of Chores</strong></h3>\n<div style=\"width:510px\"><img title=\"IMG_1070\" src=\"http://content.artofmanliness.com/uploads//2012/09/IMG_1070.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"500\" height=\"333\"><p>Gus putting the tops to our Pyrex dishes away in a drawer.</p></div>\n<p>There are two systems that emerge in adolescence that propel young folks into adulthood. One is <em>motivation and emotion</em> — as young adults move into the teen years they seek new rewards and want to branch out, travel, spend time with friends, develop ideals, compete hard in sports, get into good schools — see and do as much as possible. And they feel things very intensely. The other system is <em>control</em> — the prefrontal lobes develop, acting as a check to the newly surging emotions and aiding the adolescent in making good decisions, planning, and delaying gratification. These skills develop through trial and error — through the gaining of life experience.</p>\n<p>Human beings have the longest and latest adolescence in the animal world — and spend that time under the watchful guidance of their parents for more than a decade (and these days two). This protected and protracted adolescence allowed the two developmental systems to emerge in tandem: young adults got practice at grown-up responsibilities, but did so under the watchful eye of parents and elders who could assist and guide them when they made mistakes. Professor of Psychology Alison Gopnik <a href=\"http://online.wsj.com/article/SB10001424052970203806504577181351486558984.html\">explains</a> how the two systems have now gotten out-of-sync and how this has affected the development of young adults:</p>\n<blockquote><p>“In the past, to become a good gatherer or hunter, cook or caregiver, you would actually practice gathering, hunting, cooking and taking care of children all through middle childhood and early adolescence—tuning up just the prefrontal wiring you’d need as an adult. But you’d do all that under expert adult supervision and in the protected world of childhood, where the impact of your inevitable failures would be blunted. When the motivational juice of puberty arrived, you’d be ready to go after the real rewards, in the world outside, with new intensity and exuberance, but you’d also have the skill and control to do it effectively and reasonably safely.</p>\n<p>In contemporary life, the relationship between these two systems has changed dramatically. Puberty arrives earlier, and the motivational system kicks in earlier too.</p>\n<p>At the same time, contemporary children have very little experience with the kinds of tasks that they’ll have to perform as grown-ups. Children have increasingly little chance to practice even basic skills like cooking and caregiving. Contemporary adolescents and pre-adolescents often don’t do much of anything except go to school. Even the paper route and the baby-sitting job have largely disappeared.</p>\n<p>The experience of trying to achieve a real goal in real time in the real world is increasingly delayed, and the growth of the control system depends on just those experiences. The pediatrician and developmental psychologist Ronald Dahl at the University of California, Berkeley, has a good metaphor for the result: Today’s adolescents develop an accelerator a long time before they can steer and brake.</p>\n<p>This doesn’t mean that adolescents are stupider than they used to be. In many ways, they are much smarter. An ever longer protected period of immaturity and dependence—a childhood that extends through college—means that young humans can learn more than ever before. There is strong evidence that IQ has increased dramatically as more children spend more time in school, and there is even some evidence that higher IQ is correlated with delayed frontal lobe development.</p>\n<p>All that school means that children know more about more different subjects than they ever did in the days of apprenticeships. Becoming a really expert cook doesn’t tell you about the nature of heat or the chemical composition of salt—the sorts of things you learn in school.</p>\n<p>But there are different ways of being smart. Knowing physics and chemistry is no help with a soufflé. Wide-ranging, flexible and broad learning, the kind we encourage in high-school and college, may actually be in tension with the ability to develop finely-honed, controlled, focused expertise in a particular skill, the kind of learning that once routinely took place in human societies. For most of our history, children have started their internships when they were seven, not 27.”</p></blockquote>\n<p>I want Gus to be book smart. But I want him to be “street” smart too, and know how to do the laundry, how to clean a house, how to cook — how to function like an independent adult. Chores give children hands-on training in the basic life skills they’ll need to thrive when they head out on their own, while also developing crucial traits like hard work, responsibility, and delayed gratification.</p>\n<div style=\"width:510px\"><img title=\"IMG_1058\" src=\"http://content.artofmanliness.com/uploads//2012/09/IMG_1058.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"500\" height=\"750\"><p>Gus calls the vacuum the “namu.”</p></div>\n<p>In truth, manual tasks and higher learning go hand-in-hand. Doing chores has been shown to develop children’s large and fine motor skills; sorting laundry, sweeping, and digging in the dirt are great ways for children to develop and practice these skills. And this in turn makes them smarter. <a href=\"http://www.wired.com/geekmom/2011/09/education-week-reading-readiness-has-to-do-with-the-body\">Studies</a> show that young children who take part in hands-on activities, like chores, develop the parts of the brain that are needed for more abstract thinking like reading, writing, and math.</p>\n<p>To sum up: expecting your kids to do chores from an early age helps shape them into self-sufficient, responsible, well-rounded and well-adjusted adults. And studies bear this out. Alice Rossi, a professor of sociology at the University of Massachusetts Amherst found that doing chores as a child was a major independent predictor of whether that child would do volunteer work as an adult, and <a href=\"http://www.cehd.umn.edu/research/highlights/Rossmann/\">research</a> by Marty Rossman, a professor at the University of Minnesota, has shown that one of the best predictors of success as an adult is whether that person started regular household chores at an early age.</p>\n<h3><strong>How to Get Your Kid to Do Their Chores</strong></h3>\n<div style=\"width:510px\"><img title=\"IMG_1061\" src=\"http://content.artofmanliness.com/uploads//2012/09/IMG_1061.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"500\" height=\"333\"><p>Gus helps empty the dishwasher. Careful with that plate Gus!</p></div>\n<p><strong>Start early. </strong> <span style=\"text-decoration:underline\">The most important thing you can do to help ensure your kids do their chores is to start them as early as possible</span><span style=\"text-decoration:underline;color:#000000\"> — </span><span style=\"text-decoration:underline\">ideally  when they’re just 18 months old</span>. Psychologists  have observed that children naturally want to start helping at around this age. Michael Tomasello notes in his book <a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0262013592/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=0262013592&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;tag=stucosuccess-20\"><em>Why We Cooperate</em></a> that children as young as 18 months who see an adult having trouble opening a door or picking up a dropped clothespin will immediately lend their little hand in assistance.</p>\n<p><img title=\"IMG_1065\" src=\"http://content.artofmanliness.com/uploads//2012/09/IMG_1065.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"500\" height=\"333\"></p>\n<p>I noticed this sudden urge to help in Gus at about that age, too. When I was emptying out the dishwasher one morning, Gus came waddling over and started handing me dishes. He also started helping Kate with the laundry. He’d gather clothes off the floor and put them in the laundry basket and help her put clothes in the washer.</p>\n<p>The main thing that squelches this nascent desire to pitch in before it has a chance to fully take root is that kids are unhelpfully helpful. Their “assistance” makes the chore take a lot longer, and they often mess things up, leading parents to just want to do it themselves and quickly get it over with.</p>\n<p>Fight the urge to shoo your toddler away when he begins to naturally volunteer to help with chores. Yes, it will take longer to unload your dishwasher, but it’s much easier to instill the chore habit when your kids are young than when they’re surly teenagers. <em>Time invested now will reap rich dividends down the road.</em></p>\n<p>Begin giving your kids age-appropriate chores as soon as you notice them wanting to help and add to that list as they get older and can handle more complex tasks. A lot of parents have very low expectations of what their children can handle chore-wise — but even the littlest kids can really surprise you. Give them new tasks to try, and if they can’t do them, reintroduce them a little ways down the road.</p>\n<div style=\"width:510px\"><img title=\"IMG_1126\" src=\"http://content.artofmanliness.com/uploads//2012/09/IMG_1126.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"500\" height=\"333\"><p>Gus loves to read, but we make sure he puts all his books back when he’s done.

If you want chore-doing to stick when they’re young, make it a routine part of life. Kate and I have been trying to do this with Gus. For example, after Gus eats breakfast, I’ll have Gus take his bowl over to the sink and then we unload the dishwasher together and sweep up any detritus he might have created while eating.</p>\n<p><img title=\"IMG_1078\" src=\"http://content.artofmanliness.com/uploads//2012/09/IMG_1078.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"500\" height=\"333\"></p>\n<div style=\"width:510px\"><img title=\"IMG_1104\" src=\"http://content.artofmanliness.com/uploads//2012/09/IMG_1104.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"500\" height=\"333\"><p>Gus really enjoys cleaning out the lint from the dryer. Next thing I need to do is show him how to use said lint as a fire starter.</p></div>\n<p><strong>Offer praise.</strong> It’s easier to get your kids to do something by praising the good things they do than by reprimanding them after they make mistakes. Whenever your tyke makes an effort to help, tell him what a good job he did.</p>\n<p><strong>Make it a game. </strong>Today’s behavioral scientists are uncovering the power “gamification” has in our lives. Gamification involves using game mechanics in non-game contexts. Researchers have found that turning everyday tasks like exercise, studying, and working into a game-like experience boosts productivity and motivation. You can harness the motivating benefits of gamification with your kids’ chores. There are a few apps on the market that help you turn your kid’s chores list into a fun game with points and level-ups.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.chorewars.com/\">Chore Wars</a> is a free role-playing game that allows your kids to earn XP (experience points) and level up their character as they complete chores. You get to control how many points each chore earns. Chore Wars is free.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://highscorehouse.com/\">HighScore House</a> is another free online app that allows you to assign points for each of your kid’s chores. She can then use the points she earns from doing chores to “buy” rewards, like a half hour of television. Parents sometimes do an analog version of this kind of reward system by placing some sort of token into a jar when the kid does her chores. Once the child earns enough tokens, she can “cash” them in for rewards like video game playing time. This system, along with the idea of paying kids for chores, seems quite effective and logical on the surface, but does have some drawbacks, as we’ll discuss next…</p>\n<div style=\"width:510px\"><img title=\"IMG_1131\" src=\"http://content.artofmanliness.com/uploads//2012/09/IMG_1131.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"500\" height=\"231\"><p>One of the <a title=\"In Praise of the Push Reel Mower\" href=\"http://artofmanliness.com/2012/05/23/in-praise-of-the-push-reel-mower/\">many benefits of a push reel mower</a> is that they’re safe enough to let Gus help me push — which he loves to do. Every day when we go to the garage, Gus will head straight to the mower saying, “Push! Push! Push!” even if I mowed just the day before. Because I have to go slow when Gus is “helping” mow, and the push reel mower requires some speed to get the blades spinning, I usually just go over the rows I’ve already mowed when Gus is assisting.</p></div>\n<p><strong>Allowance for chores? </strong>There’s a lot of debate as to whether you should or should not give your kids an allowance for completing chores. One of the benefits of giving your children money in exchange for doing chores is that it teaches them the connection between work and money. They learn that if they want something in life, they have to work for it.</p>\n<p>But there are some possible downsides of trying to entice chore-completion with money, and they relate to the roots of human motivation. Psychologists break down motivation into two types: intrinsic and extrinsic. Intrinsic motivation comes from within — you want to do something because you enjoy it, it interests you, or it’s in line with your values. Extrinsic motivation comes from outside the person — either someone is  making you do something, or you’re motivated by a reward like stickers or money. The problem with extrinsic motivation is that the satisfaction gained from a task moves from the task itself to the reward for the task. Thus, if the reward is taken away, the behavior ceases. Studies have shown that once children are offered a reward for an activity, their interest in that activity declines.</p>\n<p>Intrinsic motivation leads to a greater sense of well-being and is fed by the fulfillment of 3 needs:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Competence</strong>. Sense that you can control the outcome of something and the feeling of mastery.</li>\n<li><strong>Relatedness</strong>. The desire to interact, connect with, and care for others.</li>\n<li><strong>Autonomy. </strong>The feeling of being the director of your own actions.<strong><br>\n</strong></li>\n</ul>\n<p>Paying kids money to do chores does not meet these needs nearly as well as expecting them to do chores simply because they are part of the family and need to be a contributing member of it. Kids will experience the reward as an external form of control, and as something that doesn’t have anything to do with membership in the family. And what happens if they decide the money offered isn’t worth it or Grandma slips them $100 for their birthday, and they don’t feel they need their chore allowance? Then the parent has to try to force them to do something for free they didn’t want to do for cash, creating a power struggle, and making the child feel decidedly un-autonomous. Perhaps most worrisome, offering money for doing chores can also create the sense in children that everything they do should be rewarded. This sense of entitlement can hinder their development later, when they discover that they must fulfill many adult responsibilities that don’t offer any immediate reward and simply have to be done to function independently. It can even stymy their interest in hobbies done solely for pleasure — kids taught to always look for an external reward may not see the point.</p>\n<p>The better approach, at least in my opinion, is to expect kids to do chores from an early age simply because that’s what’s expected of them as members of the family; mom and dad don’t get paid for their chores, so neither do they. This will build their competence and relatedness and thus intrinsic motivation from an early age. But you still want to teach your kids about managing their money, so each week they get an allowance not tied to chores. With guidance from mom and dad, they’re allowed to spend and budget it as they’d like. If they want to buy something out of reach of their weekly allowance, they can save and budget, or they can talk to you and the Mrs. about doing extra jobs — chores outside the scope of their expected chores — for extra pay. With this system you still help them experience the connection between hard work and getting what they want, while boosting their autonomy and their competence in managing their money.</p>\n<p><em><strong>What are your tips for getting kids to do chores?

With a frisson of excitement, you start to do some research. The euphoria is short-lived however, as you quickly discover that <strong>unless you are an experienced programmer, the task is far from easy</strong>.</p>\n<p>The documentation provided by Apple is aimed at those with a degree in computer science. Books on iOS development ask that you have a good grasp of Objective-C from the opening page. Online tutorials vary in quality, with many appearing out of date or contradictory.</p>\n<p>This post will help you get to know the iOS SDK a little better. It leads you through <strong>some choreographed steps of iOS app development</strong>, even if you have little or no programming knowledge. It covers some key principles and applies these directly to something useful and relevant: the creation of a simple but functioning portfolio app for the iPhone.</p>\n<p>The result will look like this:</p>\n<p><img title=\"iOS Portfolio App\" src=\"http://media.smashingmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/11/01-end-result.jpg\" alt=\"iOS Portfolio App\" width=\"550\" height=\"266\"></p>\n<h3>Going Native?</h3>\n<p>By “native” iOS development, we mean using Apple’s software development kit (SDK) and the programming language Objective-C to author apps for the iPhone, iPod Touch and iPad. Before we learn how to do this, it is worth mentioning why we would want to make an app this way, and what the alternatives might be.</p>\n<p>In <a href=\"http://www.engadget.com/2010/09/09/apple-backpedaling-on-some-ios-development-restrictions-will-al/\">relaxing the App Store’s submission review guidelines</a> in September 2010, Apple made it easier for developers to use third-party frameworks and more familiar languages, such as HTML, CSS and JavaScript, to create apps. Examples of such tools are <a href=\"http://www.appcelerator.com/products/titanium-mobile-application-development/\">Appcelerator’s Titanium Mobile</a>, <a href=\"http://www.phonegap.com/\">Nitobi’s PhoneGap</a> (acquired by Adobe in 2011) and <a href=\"http://www.appmobi.com/\">appMobi’s XDK</a>, among others. In addition to the benefit of using the more familiar Web languages of HTML, CSS and JavaScript to author apps, these methods enable developers to output to other mobile platforms, such as Android and BlackBerry, with minimal rewriting of the source code.</p>\n<p>The disadvantage of using third-party tools is that the resulting app will not be quite as efficient as one that is natively authored, and the newest features of the operating system and hardware will not be available, at least until the framework catches up. Each framework also has its own fairly extensive library of functions that have to be learned, along with its own idiosyncrasies, bugs and workarounds. Plus, to publish your app to the App Store, you need to use Apple’s Xcode, the application used to work with the iOS SDK, so limited familiarity with native processes is still necessary.</p>\n<p>A few “third way” solutions, such as <a href=\"http://www.cocos2d-iphone.org/about\">Cocos 2D for iPhone</a> and <a href=\"http://pugpig.com/\">PugPig</a>, are also available, allowing you to connect framework files to an Objective-C project for a particular aim, such as to create a game or magazine app. To make use of these and any others that come along in future, you will need a basic understanding of the SDK.</p>\n<p>Therefore, if you are interested in developing for the iPhone, iPod and iPad and you accept that whatever authoring method you choose means having to find your way around Xcode, then getting to grips with the native SDK is a recommended first step.</p>\n<h3>Getting Started</h3>\n<p>You will need two things to be able to start working with the iOS SDK:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>A Mac, running the latest version of OS X (there is currently no way to author natively for iOS on Windows or Linux, although apparently there is <a href=\"http://www.macincloud.com/\">a workaround</a>);</li>\n<li>Apple’s Xcode application.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>To get Xcode, download it from the Mac App Store. It’s free but weighs in at nearly 1.5 GB and can take about half an hour to install, so you’ll need to put aside a bit of time to get it up and running.</p>\n<h3>Preparing Graphics</h3>\n<p>While waiting for that download to complete, we can look at how you might prepare and export graphics for iOS using Photoshop.</p>\n<p>Because all iOS applications have one of two possible pixel densities (standard or Retina), you should aim to work in Photoshop using non-destructive techniques to reduce the need to design twice. This means creating buttons and interface elements using vector shapes and layer styles, and using smart objects for images, where possible. The recommended approach is to work at a Retina-display resolution first, and then scale down to standard resolution once the design is complete. Sometimes you will find that scaling down produces poor results, and you will have to tweak your smaller designs.</p>\n<p>Plenty of templates with pre-built iOS system elements are available on the Web. <a href=\"http://www.teehanlax.com/blog/iphone-4-gui-psd-retina-display/\">Teehan + Lax has one</a> that is pretty good and widely used. Apart from saving you from having to draw iOS system components from scratch, they also demonstrate how much space is left for content, once elements such as the status, navigation and tool bars are in place.</p>\n<p>To set up a new blank iPhone document in an image editor, these are the settings you will need:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>640 × 960 pixels,</li>\n<li>72 DPI,</li>\n<li>RGB color mode.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>The above is for a Retina display (iPhone 4+ and iPod Touch fourth generation and up). Older devices are 320 × 480 pixels, exactly half the size!</p>\n<p>See Marc Edwards’ “<a href=\"http://www.smashingmagazine.com/2010/11/17/designing-for-iphone-4-retina-display-techniques-and-workflow/\">Designing for iPhone 4 Retina Display</a>” for more information on iOS design techniques and workflows.</p>\n<h4>Some Quick Image Exporting Tips</h4>\n<ul>\n<li>iOS accepts a number of image formats, but PNG is recommended because of its support for alpha-transparency and its lossless compression.</li>\n<li>Graphics for buttons should, in most cases, be exported just as background images, without accompanying text, because this allows for localization (in different languages), accessibility and text resizing between the Retina- and standard-display resolutions.</li>\n<li>If exporting a button graphic, ensure that the pixels of the actual button are centered in the frame of the exported image, because Interface Builder doesn’t give you precise control over the positioning of button background images or foreground text. You might need to manually compensate for a drop shadow on the opposite sides, for instance.</li>\n<li>Where possible, flatten design elements made from multiple layers into a single image file. Rebuilding layered UI components in Interface Builder can be a pain; plus, reducing the number of resources that your app uses will make it run quicker and take up less memory. Only interface components that need to respond to user interaction should be animated, and only interface components that will be controlled by the application should be exported as separate image files.</li>\n<li>You will need to produce Retina and standard versions of every exported image and give them identical names, with a <code>@2x</code> suffix for the Retina version, like so:\n<ul>\n<li><code>image.png</code></li>\n<li><code>image@2x.png</code></li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>You can use my <a href=\"http://www.mightymeta.co.uk/superslicr-ditch-the-slice-tool/\">SuperSlicr Photoshop action</a> (included in the package) to automate the scaling and exporting of elements from your PSD file.</li>\n<li>Every pair of images that you make will need a unique and descriptive file name, because they are all stored in the same directory in the app bundle. File names should have only alphanumeric characters (no symbols), and underscores or hyphens instead of spaces. You may use capitalization.</li>\n<li>Photoshop isn’t very good at compressing PNGs, so run them through porneL’s <a href=\"http://imageoptim.pornel.net/\">ImageOptim</a> to reduce their size before importing into Xcode. Xcode will also try to apply its own compression to imported images, which can sometimes increase file size, but <a href=\"http://imageoptim.com/xcode.html\">this can be disabled</a>.</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Xcode Overview</h3>\n<p>You’ve successfully installed Xcode? Great!</p>\n<p>Next, you will need to download and unzip <a href=\"https://github.com/JamesBrocklehurst/Portfolio-iOS-App/downloads\">these template files</a>. The package includes a source PSD, some exported PNGs and the required starter code.</p>\n<p>In the package, navigate to the folder named <code>Begin Here</code>. Locate the Xcode project document named <code>Portfolio.xcodeproj</code>. Double-click on this file to open it in Xcode.</p>\n<p>Once the document has loaded, click on the blue project icon on the left named <code>Portfolio, 1 target, iOS SDK</code>, and you should see a project summary screen in the main Xcode interface, as shown below. We will look at the contents of the summary screen in detail later.</p>\n<p><img title=\"Xcode Overview\" src=\"http://media.smashingmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/11/03-xcode-overview.jpg\" alt=\"Xcode Overview\" width=\"550\" height=\"322\"></p>\n<p>The “Navigator” area on the left lists all of the files already associated with your project. These can be expanded out from the blue project icon. We will be mostly interested in those contained in the yellow <code>Portfolio</code> folder, or “group.” Three types of files are here:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><code>.h</code><br>\nA “header” (or interface) file.</li>\n<li><code>.m</code><br>\nA “message” (or implementation) file.</li>\n<li><code>.xib</code><br>\nAn “XML interface builder” file, sometimes referred to as a NIB.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>The “Editor” area will change depending on what task you are performing. Because we currently have the blue project file selected in the navigator, we are given the “Target Summary” screen. This gives us some basic options for our app, including which device types, iOS version and display orientation we want our app to support. We can also specify images to use for our app’s icon and launch image, which we will look at in detail later.</p>\n<p>Single-click on <code>TestAppDelegate.m</code>. The editor area will now turn into a code editor and display the code contained in this file.</p>\n<p>Now single-click on <code>MainWindow.xib</code> in the navigator area. The editor area will display Interface Builder, an integrated graphical user interface (GUI) for putting together the front-end of your application.</p>\n<p><img title=\"Interface Builder Overview\" src=\"http://media.smashingmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/11/04-interface-builder-overview.jpg\" alt=\"Interface Builder Overview\" width=\"550\" height=\"342\"></p>\n<p>The “Inspector” has some tabbed controls at the top that you will need to be familiar with. The last four are the most important:</p>\n<p><img title=\"Inspector Bar\" src=\"http://media.smashingmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/11/05-inspector-bar.jpg\" alt=\"Inspector Bar\" width=\"550\" height=\"250\"></p>\n<p>The other important control is the big “Run” button in the top-left corner of Xcode. Pressing this will compile your project code into an app and then run it in an iOS simulator so that you can see whether it works without having to load it onto an actual device. If you press it now, it should launch the simulator and present you with a big virtual iPhone on your desktop.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://media.smashingmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/03/06-ios-simulator4.jpg\"><img title=\"The iOS Simulator\" src=\"http://media.smashingmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/03/06-ios-simulator4.jpg\" alt=\"The iOS Simulator\" width=\"550\" height=\"540\"></a></p>\n<p>The simulator works similar to an actual device. Have a play to see how it behaves. Under the “Hardware” menu, you can select different devices and iOS versions and simulate rotating and shaking the device. Holding <code>alt</code> allows you to pinch and zoom. The home button works, taking you to the springboard where there is even a functioning version of mobile Safari (which, incidentally, is great for testing locally hosted websites).</p>\n<p>A more detailed guide to the interface is available in Apple’s “<a href=\"http://developer.apple.com/library/mac/#documentation/ToolsLanguages/Conceptual/Xcode4UserGuide/000-About_Xcode/about.html\">Xcode 4 User Guide</a>.”</p>\n<h3>Importing Graphics Into Xcode</h3>\n<p>The template package that you downloaded earlier contains some sample image files. You can either use these or use your own for the next section.</p>\n<p>To import images into your project, Control-click on the “Images” group in the project navigator and select “Add Files to ‘Portfolio.’”</p>\n<p><img title=\"Adding Images\" src=\"http://media.smashingmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/11/07-add-images1.jpg\" alt=\"Adding Images\" width=\"400\" height=\"381\"></p>\n<p>Browse to the “PNGs” folder in the downloaded package and select all of the images. Check the “Copy items into destination group’s folder” box, and then click “Add.”</p>\n<p>The images have now been imported into your project and are available to Xcode and Interface Builder. You can add more graphics to the “Images” group at any time by following this same process.</p>\n<h3>Editing The Template Without Writing Any Code</h3>\n<p>There is a debate in the iOS development community about whether one should build an app purely in code or with XIB files generated by Interface Builder and its GUI. Both methods seem to be supported by Apple, and each project necessitates its own approach. Developers who frown on the use of Interface Builder perhaps overlook the power of this tool, which enables us to establish the structure and outward appearance of our app efficiently and visually. For designers used to working with Adobe’s Creative Suite, this will be (almost) familiar territory. For this reason and because our app will be very “view-based,” we will use Interface Builder to begin with.</p>\n<p>First, we will look at setting up some different screens, or “views,” that can be switched using some Tab Bar controls. Click on <code>MainWindow.xib</code> in the project navigator to bring up Interface Builder. In the library, select the “Show the Object Library” tab icon (the one that looks like a cube), and scroll through the list of objects until you find “View Controller.”</p>\n<p><img title=\"View Controller Object\" src=\"http://media.smashingmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/11/08-view-controller-object.jpg\" alt=\"View Controller Object\" width=\"318\" height=\"215\"></p>\n<p>Expand the dock using the circular “Expand document outline” button at the bottom, then drag an instance of the View Controller object from the library onto the “Tab Bar Controller” in the dock. The Tab Bar Controller should expand, showing the View Controller nested inside.</p>\n<p>Repeat this process twice more, until you have three View Controllers nested inside the Tab Bar Controller. The canvas area should also show the Tab Bar as having three unnamed tabs.</p>\n<p><img title=\"View Controllers Added To Tab Bar\" src=\"http://media.smashingmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/11/09-view-controllers-added-to-tab-bar1.jpg\" alt=\"View Controllers Added To Tab Bar\" width=\"550\" height=\"514\"></p>\n<h4>View Controllers?</h4>\n<p>If you are wondering what a “View” and a “Controller” are, they are part of something called the “Model View Controller” (MVC) paradigm. This is an approach to programming that separates application data, logic and presentation to make things easier to work with. “Model” refers to the back-end aspect that manages data. “View” refers to the front-end user interface. “Controllers” bridge the front and back ends and enable things to happen in your app. We won’t be working with any stored data in this article, so we will only be encountering Views and their corresponding Controllers.</p>\n<h4>Creating Classes</h4>\n<p>We need to create some “classes” to generate each of our views; and because we are new to programming, this requires a bit of explanation first.</p>\n<p>In object-oriented programming languages such as Objective-C, classes are used as a way to define elements within the application called “objects.” A class defines the qualities (or properties) that an object may have and what it can do (methods). It can then be asked to generate one or more “instances” of an object based on this definition, and these instances are used to make your application work.</p>\n<p>Each of the three views that we want to make are objects, so we need to create some classes to be able to conjure them into existence.</p>\n<p>To add a new View Controller class, Control-click on the yellow “Portfolio” folder in the navigator, and select “New File” from the contextual menu. In the sidebar of the options sheet that follows, select “Cocoa Touch,” then “Objective-C class.”</p>\n<p><img title=\"New Objective-C Class\" src=\"http://media.smashingmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/07/new-objective-c-class.png\" alt=\"New Objective-C Class\" width=\"550\" height=\"300\"></p>\n<p>Click “Next.” Then, in the sheet that follows, enter “HomeViewController” in the “Class” field, select “UIViewController” in the “Subclass of” drop-down menu, and ensure that the “With XIB for user interface” box is checked.</p>\n<p><img title=\"Naming New View Controller\" src=\"http://media.smashingmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/11/11-naming-new-view-controller.jpg\" alt=\"Naming New View Controller\" width=\"550\" height=\"155\"></p>\n<p>Clicking “Next” will give you a save dialogue box. Select the “Begin Here &gt; Portfolio” folder, and then hit “Create.”</p>\n<p>Repeat this process for the other two views, naming each class “PortfolioViewController” and “ContactViewController,” respectively.</p>\n<p>You can rearrange the order of the files in the navigator by dragging and dropping if you want. It should now look something like this:</p>\n<p><img title=\"View Controllers Added To Project Navigator\" src=\"http://media.smashingmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/11/12-view-controllers-added-to-navigator1.jpg\" alt=\"View Controllers Added To Project Navigator\" width=\"259\" height=\"320\"></p>\n<h4>Configuring Tabs and Views</h4>\n<p>Return to <code>MainWindow.xib</code>. Select the first View Controller icon in the dock, then the Identity inspector. Select “HomeViewController” from the “Class” drop-down menu.</p>\n<p><img title=\"Connecting HomeViewController Class\" src=\"http://media.smashingmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/11/13-connecting-home-viewcontroller1.jpg\" alt=\"Connecting HomeViewController Class\" width=\"259\" height=\"177\"></p>\n<p>Now go to the Attributes inspector. Type “Home” in the “Title” field, and select “HomeViewController” as the NIB name.</p>\n<p><img title=\"Connecting HomeViewController XIB\" src=\"http://media.smashingmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/11/14-connecting-homeviewcontroller-xib.jpg\" alt=\"Connecting HomeViewController XIB\" width=\"259\" height=\"144\"></p>\n<p>Expand the View Controller in the dock and select its “Tab Bar Item.” In the Attributes inspector, set the title as “Home,” and select <code>tab-icon-home.png</code> from the Image drop-down menu. You don’t need to specify the <code>@2x</code> Retina version when selecting images in Xcode because they are called automatically when the application is running.</p>\n<p><img title=\"Customizing Tab Name And Icon\" src=\"http://media.smashingmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/11/15-customise-tab-name-and-icon.jpg\" alt=\"Customizing Tab Name And Icon\" width=\"259\" height=\"201\"></p>\n<p>Repeat the above process for the Portfolio and Contact views, choosing the relevant classes, titles and image files.</p>\n<p>The color of the tab bar highlight can be changed by selecting the main “Tab Bar” object in the dock, then “Image Tint” in the Attributes inspector. Although custom tints will only show up in devices running iOS 5 or higher, iOS 4 and below will safely fall back to showing the default blue highlight color.</p>\n<p>Our views within tabs are now all set up! To check that they are working properly, we’ll need to add some dummy content to each view.</p>\n<p>Select <code>HomeViewController.xib</code> in the navigator, then drag a “Label” from the library (at the top of the list) onto the view represented in the canvas. Double-clicking on the label in the canvas will allow you to edit its text. Change it to “Home.”</p>\n<p><img title=\"Adding a label to the Home view \" src=\"http://media.smashingmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/11/16-adding-label-to-home-view1.jpg\" alt=\"Adding A Label To The Home View\" width=\"380\" height=\"129\"></p>\n<p>Repeat this for <code>PortfolioViewController.xib</code> and <code>ContactViewController.xib</code>, naming the labels appropriately.</p>\n<p>Now hit the “Run” button, and check out your already functioning tabbed app in the simulator!</p>\n<p><img title=\"App Test with Labels\" src=\"http://media.smashingmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/12/17-app-test-with-labels-2.jpg\" alt=\"App Test With Labels\" width=\"257\" height=\"500\"></p>\n<h3>Adding Graphics And Text To The Views</h3>\n<p>As with desktop publishing applications, inserting images and text in Interface Builder requires you to make a containing element first. These can be dragged onto the canvas from the library, and they are called “Image View” and “Text View,” respectively. They can be repositioned and resized visually with the cursor, or you can type pixel measurements into the Size inspector for more precise control.</p>\n<p>The Attributes inspector allows us to specify an image to place in the Image view. We may only choose from images that have been imported into the project.</p>\n<p>The Attributes inspector also lets us set text for the Text view, and it gives us typography controls, a background color-picker and scrollbar options.</p>\n<p>Arrange the graphics for <code>HomeViewController.xib</code>. Delete the label, and drag on an Image view from the library, setting its image’s name to <code>home-bg.png</code> and its mode to “Top Left” using the Attributes inspector.</p>\n<p><img title=\"Attributes Inspector Select Image\" src=\"http://media.smashingmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/07/attributes-select-image.png\" alt=\"Attributes Inspector Select Image\" width=\"259\" height=\"159\"></p>\n<p>In the Size inspector, check that the Image view has an X value of <code>0</code>, a Y value of <code>-20</code>, a width of <code>320</code> and a height of <code>480</code>.</p>\n<p><img title=\"The Size Inspector\" src=\"http://media.smashingmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/07/size-inspector1.png\" alt=\"The Size Inspector\" width=\"259\" height=\"266\"></p>\n<p>Next, position a Text view over top. Editing its content, center-align the text, set the text’s color to white, set a custom font (Snell Roundhand, Regular, 24 pixels), and set the background color to “Clear.”</p>\n<p><img title=\"Attributes Inspector Text View Controls\" src=\"http://media.smashingmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/07/attributes-inspector-text-view-controls.png\" alt=\"Attributes Inspector Text View Controls\" width=\"259\" height=\"159\"></p>\n<p>The result should look like this:</p>\n<p><img title=\"Adding Graphics To Home\" src=\"http://media.smashingmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/11/18-adding-graphics-to-home.jpg\" alt=\"Adding Graphics To Home\" width=\"346\" height=\"500\"></p>\n<p>Because our views are being placed inside a tab bar interface, we also need to simulate the black strip at the bottom of each view so that we can arrange items with this in mind. To do this, select the main “View” object in the dock. Then, in the Attribute inspector, under “Simulated Metrics,” choose “Tab Bar” from the “Bottom Bar” drop-down menu:</p>\n<p><img title=\"Simulated Metrics\" src=\"http://media.smashingmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/11/19-simulated-metrics.jpg\" alt=\"Simulated Metrics\" width=\"259\" height=\"247\"></p>\n<p>This won’t actually add a tab bar to our view. It simply provides a visual reference to help us position the layout.</p>\n<p>Now, have a go at arranging the graphics and text for the Portfolio and Contact views. Either use the sample images at the top of this article, or refer to the source PSD provided in the template package.</p>\n<p>When creating the thumbnail images in the Portfolio view and the social media buttons in the Contact view, <strong>use the “Round Rect Buttons” from the library instead of Image views</strong>. If you set the button type to “Custom” in the Attributes inspector, you can then set the button’s image in the same way as you would for an Image view. Set the button size in the Size inspector based on the image’s original dimensions. Using a “Round Rect Button” instead of an Image view allows us to add interactivity to them later.</p>\n<p>Now, build and run to check that everything works OK in the simulator.</p>\n<h3>Extra Finesse</h3>\n<p>If you press the simulator’s home button, you will notice that your app has an uninspiring white icon on the springboard and a blank screen when it relaunches. Let’s fix that now.</p>\n<p>Clicking on the blue “Portfolio” project icon in the navigator will take you back to the summary screen. Scrolling to the bottom of this screen will reveal empty wells awaiting custom images. Adding images is simply a case of dragging them from the Finder to the relevant well.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://media.smashingmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/03/20-app-icon-launch-image-wells3.jpg\"><img title=\"App Icon And Launch Image Wells\" src=\"http://media.smashingmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/03/20-app-icon-launch-image-wells3.jpg\" alt=\"App Icon And Launch Image Wells\" width=\"550\" height=\"500\"></a></p>\n<p>You will find the images you need for this project in the “App Icons” directory in the downloaded package.</p>\n<p>If you want to make your own app icon, the images need to conform to the following sizes:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Standard: 57 × 57 pixels,</li>\n<li>Retina: 114 × 114 pixels.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>The launch images need to be the same as the display’s overall dimensions:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Standard: 480 × 320 pixels,</li>\n<li>Retina: 960 × 640 pixels.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>You will at a later date need some more sizes to display your app correctly in various contexts. An excellent resource detailing the required sizes has been <a href=\"http://mrgan.tumblr.com/post/708404794/ios-app-icon-sizes\">produced by Neven Mrgan</a>. Apple’s “iOS Human Interface Guidelines” also give a <a href=\"http://developer.apple.com/library/ios/#DOCUMENTATION/UserExperience/Conceptual/MobileHIG/IconsImages/IconsImages.html\">good breakdown</a> and include icon and launch image sizes for the new iPad.</p>\n<p>iOS automatically rounds the corners of your app’s icon and overlays the standard glossy sheen on it, too, so you don’t need to include these elements in your design.</p>\n<p>If, however, you want to create your own non-standard glossy effect or you don’t want gloss on your icon at all, then check the “Prerendered” box to the right of the App Icon wells.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://media.smashingmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/03/23-icon-gloss-eg2.png\"><img title=\"Icon Prerendered Example\" src=\"http://media.smashingmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/03/23-icon-gloss-eg2.png\" alt=\"Icon Prerendered Example\" width=\"550\" height=\"145\"></a></p>\n<p>To change the name that appears below the icon, select the “Info” tab next to the “Summary” tab at the top of the editor. This will reveal an editor for the app’s <code>.plist</code> (property list) file, which is an XML document containing the main settings for your app:</p>\n<p><img title=\"App Info Plist\" src=\"http://media.smashingmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/11/21-info-plist.jpg\" alt=\"App Info Plist\" width=\"550\" height=\"299\"></p>\n<p>Some of the information here, such as “Main nib file base name,” points to resources required by the app when it first launches. Other information, such as “Bundle Identifier,” is used in the black art of provisioning and uploading to iTunes Connect for distribution on the App Store.</p>\n<p>To change the name below the icon, change the “Bundle display name” value from <code>${PRODUCT_NAME}</code> to whatever you want.</p>\n<h3>The Minor Miracles Of The Xcode Assistant Editor</h3>\n<p>When we test our app, the custom buttons will respond to being tapped but won’t actually do anything. To make them work, we’ll need to write some code. Luckily, something called the Assistant Editor can help us with the first part of this process.</p>\n<p>Select <code>ContactViewController.xib</code> from the navigator. Then, press the “Assistant Editor“ button in the top right of the Xcode window.</p>\n<p><img title=\"Assistant Editor Toggle\" src=\"http://media.smashingmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/11/24-assistant-editor-toggle.jpg\" alt=\"Assistant Editor Toggle\" width=\"260\" height=\"97\"></p>\n<p>This will display an Interface Builder window detailing <code>ContactViewController.xib</code>, alongside a Code Editor window, which shows the associated <code>ContactViewController.h</code> interface document. In the example below, the dock has been minimized, and the Utility area hidden to give the two editors more room. The Code Editor is also using the “Dusk” theme, which can be found under “Fonts and Colors” in <code>Xcode → Preferences</code>.</p>\n<p><img title=\"The Assistant Editor In Action\" src=\"http://media.smashingmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/11/25-assistant-editor-in-action.jpg\" alt=\"The Assistant Editor In Action\" width=\"550\" height=\"329\"></p>\n<h4>Miracle 1: Declaring Properties and Methods</h4>\n<p>Features of a class generally fall into two main types: a “property,” which is a characteristic that the class might possess, and a “method,” which is something that it can do. When adding a button to ContactViewController, we need to declare the button as a property of the class and create a method for what happens when the button is tapped by the user.</p>\n<p>The <code>.h</code> document should contain the following code:</p>\n<pre>\n#import &lt;UIKit/UIKit.h&gt;\n@interface ContactViewController : UIViewController\n@end\n</pre>\n<p>The <code>#import</code> statement at the top gives the class access to the required iOS user interface classes stored within the UIKit framework.</p>\n<p>The <code>@interface</code> declaration starts by defining ContactViewController and stating that it is a subclass (meaning that it inherits all the features) of the UIViewController class, which is defined within UIKit.</p>\n<p>We can add in extra items between the opening <code>@interface</code> declaration and its <code>@end</code>, to build on the foundation provided by the UIViewController class.</p>\n<p>To do this, Control-click on our orange “WWW” button on the canvas in Interface Builder, drag the cursor to be just above <code>@end</code> in the code editor, and then release. A little dialogue box will pop up with some settings:</p>\n<p><img title=\"Outlet Dialogue\" src=\"http://media.smashingmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/11/26-outlet-dialogue.jpg\" alt=\"Outlet Dialogue\" width=\"550\" height=\"154\"></p>\n<p>Check that the “Connection” is set to “Outlet,” type in the name <code>websiteButton</code>, and then press “Connect.” Xcode will insert a line of code into the <code>.h</code> document for you.</p>\n<p>Repeat the process, this time changing “Connection” to “Action” and providing the name <code>openWebsite</code>.</p>\n<p><img title=\"Action Dialogue\" src=\"http://media.smashingmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/11/27-action-dialogue.jpg\" alt=\"Action Dialogue\" width=\"550\" height=\"200\"></p>\n<p>The code in your <code>.h</code> document should now look like this:</p>\n<pre>\n#import &lt;UIKit/UIKit.h&gt;\n@interface ContactViewController : UIViewController\n@property (retain, nonatomic) IBOutlet UIButton *websiteButton;\n- (IBAction) openWebsite:(id)sender;\n@end\n</pre>\n<p>So, what does this all mean?</p>\n<p>The <code>@property</code> declaration states that the ContactViewController class has a property. It begins with some parameters: <code>retain</code>, which has to do with memory management (more on this later), and <code>nonatomic</code>, which means that it is not “multithreaded,” something that is common to all iOS properties. Next, there is a definition for the property return type, <code>IBOutlet</code>, which allows us to bind our code to the button we created in Interface Builder. <code>UIButton</code> states that the property will inherit from the UIButton class, defined within UIKit, and then the name of our property is given, which is <code>websiteButton</code>.</p>\n<p>The second line of code is a method declaration. It starts by saying that it is an <code>IBAction</code>, which again lets us bind the code to the button object in the XIB. Then it is given a name, in this case, <code>openWebsite</code>. The <code>(id)sender</code> parameter tells us which object called the method. This is handy in certain situations, although we don’t need it right now.</p>\n<p>You might have noticed that when we created our View Controller classes, their names began with an uppercase letter, whereas the names we gave our property and method didn’t. This is an Objective-C naming convention and should be adhered to.</p>\n<p>Hand-coding those two lines is possible, but using the Assistant Editor to do it saves a bit of time and ensures that the syntax is correct. It also performs a whole series of other tasks for us as well. Let’s look at what else it does.</p>\n<h4>Miracle 2: Property Synthesis and Memory Management</h4>\n<p>Return to “Standard Editor” mode, and select <code>ContactViewController.m</code>. Around line 12, you should see this directive that the assistant has put in for us:</p>\n<pre>\n@synthesize websiteButton;\n</pre>\n<p>This will ask the compiler to “synthesize” some extra methods for us when the app is built, for setting and getting variables for our property. This all happens behind the scenes and saves us from having to deal with even more code, so it really is useful.</p>\n<p>Lower down, we find the following:</p>\n<pre>\n- (IBAction)openWebsite:(id)sender {\n}\n</pre>\n<p>This is the method implementation for our button action. In a minute, we will put some code in there to make our button work.</p>\n<p>You should also find another method implementation that looks like this:</p>\n<pre>\n- (void) dealloc {\n[websiteButton release];\n[super dealloc];\n}\n</pre>\n<p>This method has to do with memory management and is defined within the Cocoa framework, which is why we haven’t needed to mention it in our interface.</p>\n<p>Managing memory is very important when programming because a mobile device doesn’t have much to play with. When the <code>websiteButton</code> property is defined, a chunk of memory is allocated to it using the <code>retain</code> command. This command asks iOS to reserve a bit of memory for the button until we tell it to let it go. The <code>dealloc</code> method is activated only when the View instance is destroyed; so, by putting <code>websiteButton release</code> in there, we are asking iOS to free up the memory set aside for the button when this event occurs. If we don’t do this, then the memory keeps getting allocated, even when the button object isn’t in use anymore. This is called a “memory leak.” If left unchecked, these leaks will add up, affecting the app’s responsiveness and the device’s battery life and causing all sorts of other horrors!</p>\n<p>Thankfully, once again, the assistant editor has set this all up for us, so we don’t need to remember to do it. Hooray!</p>\n<p>It is probably worth mentioning that version 5 of the iOS SDK comes with “Automatic Reference Counting” (ARC), which seeks to further automate memory management for iOS developers. When creating a new project, you have the option to turn ARC on and off. We are not using ARC in this project, so we can learn a bit about how memory management works. Integrating freely available components found on the Internet (many of which are written using manual reference counting) with an ARC-enabled project can also be difficult. With each subsequent release of the SDK, however, Apple is pushing more and more for developers to embrace ARC, and there are many advantages in doing so. <a href=\"http://maniacdev.com/ios-5-sdk-tutorial-and-guide/arc-automatic-reference-counting/\">ManiacDev has compiled some useful resources</a> to make this transition smoother.</p>\n<h4>Miracle 3: Code Binding</h4>\n<p>The Assistant Editor has also connected our code to the button object in the XIB. Select <code>ContactViewController.xib</code>, expand the dock, and under “Placeholders” select “File’s Owner.” This represents the ContactViewController class. Now, select the Connections inspector. It should look like this:</p>\n<p><img title=\"Connections Inspector\" src=\"http://media.smashingmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/11/28-connections-inspector.jpg\" alt=\"Connections Inspector\" width=\"258\" height=\"214\"></p>\n<p>Under “Outlets,” we can see the <code>websiteButton</code> property linked to the Button XIB object.</p>\n<p>Under “Received Actions,” we can see that the <code>openWebsite</code> method is also connected to the Button.</p>\n<p>Under it, there is also an associated event, “Touch Up Inside.” This means that the method will be called when the user touches and then releases their finger while still inside the button. This is the default touch event.</p>\n<h3>Handwriting Your First Bit Of Objective-C</h3>\n<p>Lets make that button do something!</p>\n<p>Change the <code>openWebsite</code> method implementation in <code>ContactViewController.m</code> so that it looks like the following:</p>\n<pre>\n- (IBAction)openWebsite:(id)sender {\nNSURL *webAddress = [NSURL URLWithString:@\"http:www.mightymeta.co.uk\"];\n[[UIApplication sharedApplication] openURL:webAddress];\n}\n</pre>\n<p>The syntax for a method is fairly straightforward. Simply provide the name of the method, and then put what you want to happen when the method is called between the pair of curly braces.</p>\n<p>In this case, we are doing two things. First, we are creating a temporary variable named <code>webAddress</code> and assigning it a string of text that contains our email URL.</p>\n<p>It is worth noting that this is something called a “convenience method.” It creates an instance of the NSURL class and automatically allocates some memory to it. It also sorts out the memory deallocation for you, so you don’t have to worry about releasing the <code>webAddress</code> variable.</p>\n<p>The second line asks the OS to open the URL in a relevant application, which in this case would be the default Web browser.</p>\n<p>Build and run to test whether it works.</p>\n<p>To make the other buttons work, simply repeat the steps that we went through to create this button. Any <code>mailto:</code> URLs will work and will launch the default mail client. To make a phone call, put <code>tel:</code>, followed by the number you want to dial in place of the URL. You can change the name of the temporary variable to suit the purpose for each button.</p>\n<h3>Making a View Appear Modally</h3>\n<p>The portfolio section currently has some thumbnail images. Wouldn’t it be great if the user could tap on these to get bigger versions?</p>\n<p>This can be achieved by creating what is called a “Modal View.” This is essentially a new view that is placed over top the previous one, and it comes with a range of animated transitions into view.</p>\n<h4>Create the Modal View</h4>\n<p>Modals are easy to create. First, generate a new class called <code>BigImageViewController</code> (Control-click on the “Test” folder in the project navigator, select “New File” and then the <code>UIViewController</code> subclass).</p>\n<p>Open the corresponding XIB in Interface Builder, add an Image view that fills the entire view, and set its image as <code>portfolio-modal-bg.png.</code> Add a custom Round Rect button, give it a background of <code>button-close.png</code>, set the color of the “Close” title to white, and place it in the top-left corner.</p>\n<p>Next, place another image view over top the first. Fit it to near the edges of the paper background, but don’t assign an image to it:</p>\n<p><img title=\"Creating A Modal View\" src=\"http://media.smashingmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/11/29-creating-modal1.jpg\" alt=\"Creating A Modal View\" width=\"352\" height=\"500\"></p>\n<p>Use the Assistant Editor to declare the empty Image view as an outlet named <code>imageFrame</code>, and connect the button to an action named <code>closeView</code> in <code>BigImageViewController.h</code> (you can select which file the right-hand window will display from the bar at its top):</p>\n<pre>\n@property (retain, nonatomic) IBOutlet UIImageView *imageFrame;\n- (IBAction)closeView:(id)sender;\n</pre>\n<p>Then type the following into the <code>closeView</code> method in <code>BigImageViewController.m</code>:</p>\n<pre>\n- (IBAction)closeView:(id)sender {\n[self dismissModalViewControllerAnimated:YES];\n}\n</pre>\n<p>This code will close the modal view when the button is tapped.</p>\n<h4>Code for Launching the Modal</h4>\n<p>Now, using the Standard Editor, type in <code>PortfolioViewController.h</code> so that it looks like the following example:</p>\n<pre>\n#import &lt;UIKit/UIKit.h&gt;\n#import &quot;BigImageViewController.h&quot;\n@interface PortfolioViewController : UIViewController\n@property (nonatomic, retain) UIImage *bigImage;\n- (IBAction) selectImage1;\n- (void) openBigImageView;\n@end\n</pre>\n<p>Make sure to include the <code>#import</code> statement for the <code>BigImageViewController</code> header file. This is required so that we can send a message to this class and ask it to create an instance of itself.</p>\n<p>A property and two method declarations are there. The second, <code>openBigImage</code>, doesn’t need to be connected to any objects in the XIB; so, it has a return type of <code>(void)</code>, meaning… well, a big black hole of nothingness.</p>\n<p>We haven’t used the Assistant Editor here because we are doing something a little different from before. Because of this, we need to manually synthesize and release the <code>bigImage</code> property at the start of <code>PortfolioView.m</code>, like so:</p>\n<pre>\n@implementation PortfolioViewController\n@synthesize bigImage;\n- (void) dealloc {\n[bigImage release];\n[super dealloc];\n}\n</pre>\n<p>Underneath the <code>dealloc</code> method, implement the two methods that we declared in the header:</p>\n<pre>\n- (IBAction) selectImage1 {\nself.bigImage = [UIImage imageNamed: @\"image1-big.png\"];\n[self openBigImageView];\n}\n- (void) openBigImageView {\nBigImageViewController *bigImageView = [[[BigImageViewController alloc] initWithNibName:@BigImageViewController bundle:nil] autorelease];\nbigImageView.modalTransitionStyle = UIModalTransitionStyleFlipHorizontal;\n[self presentModalViewController:bigImageView animated:YES];\n[bigImageView.imageFrame setImage:bigImage];\n}\n</pre>\n<p>Wow, that’s a lot to take in. Lets go through it.</p>\n<p>The <code>selectImage1</code> method sets the <code>bigImage</code> property to the image file that we want to use, and then calls the <code>openBigImageView</code> method.</p>\n<p>The <code>openBigImageView</code> creates an instance of the <code>BigImageViewController</code> class named <code>bigImageView</code>, presents it as a modal using the “flip” transition style, and then sends its <code>imageFrame</code> the image file held by the <code>bigImage</code> property.</p>\n<p>Because we have manually allocated memory to the instance of <code>BigImageViewController</code>, we need to release it at some point, but we don’t know how long the object will be needed for because it depends on how long the user keeps the modal active. The <code>autorelease</code> command helps us with this problem because it asks iOS to hold on to the memory for a bit and then release it later on, when it is deemed safe to do so.</p>\n<h4>Manual Code Binding</h4>\n<p>Now we need to connect our code to the objects in the XIB. Select <code>PortfolioViewController.xib</code>, and then the “File’s Owner” object in the dock, and then the Connections inspector.</p>\n<p>Under “Received Actions,” you will find the <code>selectImage1</code> method, and an empty circle to the right of it. Click and drag a connection from this circle over to the relevant thumbnail button:</p>\n<p><img title=\"Binding A Button To Code Manually\" src=\"http://media.smashingmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/11/30-binding-button.jpg\" alt=\"Binding A Button To Code Manually\" width=\"550\" height=\"297\"></p>\n<p>Select “Touch Up Inside” from the list of button events that appears.</p>\n<p>Build and run to see whether it works. If everything is in place, you should be able to tap the thumbnail to reveal the bigger image.</p>\n<p>See if you can work out how to do the same for the other images on the portfolio page. You will need to create <code>selectImage2</code>, <code>selectImage3</code> and <code>selectImage4</code> methods, but you won’t need another <code>openBigImage</code>. You could also try using different transition styles; you have four to choose from:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><code>UIModalTransitionStyleCoverVertical</code></li>\n<li><code>UIModalTransitionStyleCrossDissolve</code></li>\n<li><code>UIModalTransitionStyleFlipHorizontal</code></li>\n<li><code>UIModalTransitionStylePartialCurl</code></li>\n</ul>\n<p>If you get really stuck, have a look at the completed project in the “End Result” folder of your downloaded template package.</p>\n<h3>In Conclusion</h3>\n<p>We’ve covered quite a lot of ground, having looked at the basics of the Xcode interface and how to arrange visual elements in Interface Builder. We’ve also been introduced to the key concepts of classes, properties, methods and memory management in Objective-C.</p>\n<p>In the process, we have built a functioning, albeit limited, app. Making it ready for submission to the App Store would require a unique design and some additional functionality, such as adding Tweets to that empty speech bubble on the home page. Now that you have a grasp of the basics, take advantage of the great resources out there to help you with this next step.</p>\n<h3>Further Reading And Resources</h3>\n<h4>App Design</h4>\n<ul>\n<li>“<a href=\"http://dinosaurswithlaserz.com/2011/02/17/apple-human-interface-guidelines/\">iOS Human Interface Guidelines Part 1: Platform Characteristics</a>,” Dinosaurs with Laserz<br>\nA summary of the “iOS Human Interface Guidelines.”</li>\n<li><a href=\"http://pttrns.com/\">Pttrns</a><br>\nApp design screenshots to inspire your next masterpiece.</li>\n</ul>\n<h4>App Development</h4>\n<ul>\n<li>“<a href=\"http://cocoadevcentral.com/d/learn_objectivec/\">Learn Objective-C</a>,” Cocoa Dev Central<br>\nA summary of the basics of Objective-C.</li>\n<li><a href=\"http://cocoacontrols.com/\">Cocoa Controls</a><br>\nOpen-source UI components, such as carousels, maps and Twitter aggregators, to integrate in your project.</li>\n<li><a href=\"http://maniacdev.com/\">ManiacDev.com</a><br>\niOS libraries, controls, tutorials, examples and tools, many of which are open source.</li>\n<li><a href=\"http://bakerframework.com/\">Baker Ebook Framework</a> and <a href=\"http://pugpig.com/\">PugPig</a><br>\nThese enable you to build an interactive book or magazine using HTML5 and then wrap it into an app using Xcode.</li>\n<li><a href=\"http://gamesalad.com/creator\">Creator</a>, GameSalad<br>\nWant to make a promotional iPhone game using drag-and-drop behaviors and your new-found Xcode skills?

Some of use need more. Like, at least 43 more.</p> <p>Apple actually includes 43 incredible wallpapers with a 3200×2000 resolution that are hidden inside OS X Mountain Lion. They include stuff like scenery from National Geographics, nature patterns, and cosmic photos from the Hubble telescope.

Don't get stuck in any of these jargon traps.</p><p>Making a company successful requires, above all, clear thinking.</p><p>Unfortunately, there are dozens of management concepts that, far from making success easier, tend to encourage fuzzy ideas and bad decisions.</p><p>Here are a few of my favorites. Make sure you're not falling into any of these traps:</p><p><b>1. Consensus</b></p><p>Managers often strive to reach consensus among groups and individuals before any important decision is made. That sounds reasonable (hey, it's the \"wisdom of crowds\"), but in practice consensus drives weak decisions.</p><p>Strong decisions--the ones that create powerful futures--entail cutting away other options, and that generally means disappointing somebody. Consensus favors what's bland over what's innovative, what's safe over what's risky, and the status quo over carpe diem.</p><p><b>2. Customer Focus</b></p><p>If you focus on the customer, you'll be better able to satisfy the customer's needs, right?  Well, not really. \"Focusing\" on the customer is viewing the situation from your own perspective as a vendor. What's really required is the ability to listen to and absorb what the customer is saying and project yourself into the customer's shoes.</p><p>Understanding a customer is not so much a visual act (like using a microscope) as a passive act: It involves rapport, empathy, and imagination.</p><p><b>3. Brainstorming</b></p><p>Getting people together to bounce ideas off one another (in a supportive environment) sounds like a great idea. Until you actually try making it work, that is. Creativity is not a group process, and great ideas do not emerge out of dumb, half-baked ones.</p><p>What's more, no matter how supportive the environment, people know they'll be judged on the quality of their contributions. That's why brainstorming usually creates nothing more than a dull drizzle.</p><p><b>4. Rightsizing</b></p><p>Rightsizing is a weasel word intended to make mass firings seem as if they're strategic. The real truth is that big layoffs are always the result of lousy management. Though it's sometimes necessary to make staffing changes, well-run companies with farsighted management never require such drastic surgery. So let's stop using jargon that hides the fact that management failed.</p><p><b><b></b>5. Human Resources</b></p><p>The problem with calling humans \"resources\" is that you just dehumanized them into objects. The term puts human beings conceptually in the same bucket as raw materials on the factory floor or the network wires inside the wall. It ignores the fact that people are complicated and multifaceted, and that getting them to work together requires treating them as individuals rather than as plug-and-play commodities.</p><p><b>6. Leadership</b></p><p>Before he died, the management visionary Peter Drucker pinned the excesses of corporate America on the bloated concept of leadership. He believed businesses have more than enough leaders; what they really need are competent managers who can do the hard work of decision making, planning, and coaching.</p><p>In my experience, the typical business leader is like the leader of a marching band--he waves a stick while other people do the work.</p><p>Needless to say, feel free to leave a comment if you disagree.</p><p>If you like this post, sign up for the <a href=\"http://app.expressemailmarketing.com/Survey.aspx?SFID=125004\">free Sales Source newsletter</a>.</p>"

Yesterday we completed the series we ran every day last month: Heading Out on Your Own: 31 Basic Life Skills in 31 Days. The goal of the series was simple: to help young men heading out on their own for the first time learn some of the very basic life skills they would need to succeed at living independently. To this end, each day last month we published one article on a variety of basic life skills from personal finance to home-ec know-how.</p>\n<p>While we couldn’t have possibly covered every single skill a young man will need to know to successfully live on his own, I really believe we covered nearly all of the important essentials. If you’re a man who’s been living on his own for a long time now, I hope the articles provided an interesting and helpful refresher on skills that we truly use our whole lives through (and all need reminders on from time to time), and maybe even imparted some tips you had never learned before. If you’re a young man heading out on his own right now, our sincere wish is that the series has given you a sense of direction, competence, and confidence about this new and exciting season in your life. Knowing, as GI Joe has taught us, is half the battle. The other half will be won by honing your skills in the only way they can be: through practical experience — trial and error. Don’t be afraid to make mistakes — just commit yourself to always learning from them. We wish you the very best as you embark on whatever new adventure awaits you, and wherever it leads, we hope you enjoy the ride!</p>\n<p>If you missed any of the days during the series, or would like to go back and revisit them, here are links to all 31 articles:</p>\n<p><a title=\"View this post, &quot;Heading Out on Your Own — Day 1: Develop a Self-Reliant Mentality&quot;\"

Ebook?</strong></h3>\n<p>Throughout the series, we’ve gotten a ton of requests to turn the articles into an ebook. We definitely plan to do so. It may take awhile to put together, but once it’s done, we’ll put up a post announcing that it is available.</p>\n<h3><strong>Many Thank You’s and One Apology</strong></h3>\n<p>We want to thank our contributing writers — <a href=\"http://www.realmenrealstyle.com/\">Antonio Centeno</a>, <a href=\"http://www.rutabaga.com/\">Darren Bush</a>, and <a href=\"http://www.haveheroverfordinner.com/\">Matt Moore</a> — for offering their unique skill sets and wisdom to the series. A big thank you also goes out to <a href=\"http://www.samhakes.com/\">Sam Hakes</a> for performing some graphic design magic on a couple of posts, <a href=\"http://www.storytellersworkshop.com/\">Ted Slampyak</a> for his incredible illustrations, <a href=\"http://www.jordancrowderfilms.com/\">Jordan Crowder</a> for creating his gem of a video on the Do It Now principle, and <a href=\"http://www.jeremyedits.com/\">Jeremy Anderberg</a> for his help in editing the articles. We could not have done the series without the invaluable contributions of these very talented and supportive gentlemen.</p>\n<p>Now for an apology…when we introduced the series we said we’d also keep up with publishing regular content in addition to the articles for the series. But we were only somewhat successful in that, as writing the Heading Out on Your Own articles turned out to be much more work than we had anticipated — who knew there was so much to know about “basic” life skills?! Which brings me to…</p>\n<h3><strong>Gone Fishin’!</strong></h3>\n<p>In just a month, we wrote over 75,000 words from scratch (in comparison, our first book, <a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1600614620/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=1600614620&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;tag=stucosuccess-20\"><em>The Art of Manliness: Classic Skills and Manners for the Modern Man</em></a> clocked in at around 65,000 words). Writing 2,000-4,000 word articles nearly every single day for a month was truly one of the most grueling things we’ve ever done — we haven’t been this tired and sleep-deprived since Gus came home from the hospital! So we’ll be taking the next week and a half off from posting on the blog to let our brains recuperate and then to start digging into new research for when we return.</p>\n<p>While we’re away, check out the list below.

It actually first appeared in print way back in 1640. The saying was born among sailors, who needed to both keep things orderly in the tiny galleys and cabins below deck, and to make sure all their tools and ropes were placed and secured properly up above, so that things didn’t wash overboard when the ship was rocked by storms and waves.</p>\n<blockquote><p>“First then, while you are little boys, let there be order in everything. Try and have a place for everything and everything in its place. If your father has things in that way, see that you place everything back after using it. Hours, days, yea, months and years, are wasted by too many in hunting tools and farming implements; time thus wasted is time needlessly lost, precious time that will never return…I mention this first because it <em>is first in importance. </em>It governs your every act through life. If you start life thus and have a place for everything, you cannot fail to make good farmers.” -<em>Report of the Secretary of the Iowa State Agricultural Society</em>, 1865</p></blockquote>\n<p>“A place for everything and everything in its place” came ashore in the 19<sup>th</sup> century, and was adopted most rigorously by farmers, who owned and used a wide variety of tools and pieces of equipment, and who couldn’t afford to leave them to rust in the rain or exposed to elements during winter. Keeping track of their tools ensured they could get to work when they needed to, and there was always plenty of work to be done.</p>\n<p><img title=\"blacksmith\" src=\"http://content.artofmanliness.com/uploads//2012/08/blacksmith.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"500\" height=\"367\"></p>\n<p>The maxim was subsequently taken up by men in all trades and businesses, white and blue collar alike, who saw how having a set place for their tools and papers, both at home and at work, contributed to their success. The standard espoused in old books was for a man to be able to dress himself in the dark or find any tool in his shed with his eyes closed.</p>\n<p>While a man’s tools and necessities may have changed over the centuries, the wisdom in “a place for everything and everything in its place” remains the same. Whether at school, work, or home, creating a system of order for your possessions will create numerous benefits in your life.</p>\n<h3><strong>The Importance of Having a Place for Everything and Everything in Its Place</strong></h3>\n<blockquote><p>“Soldiers of every grade must especially <em>avoid slovenliness: </em>they must bear in mind the proverb, ‘A Place For EVERYTHING AND EVERYTHING IN ITS PLACE’…When a soldier can bring himself to be habitually exact in small things, he may be safely regarded as reliable in important matters: but he who is negligent over apparent trifles, will find it difficult, if not impossible, to be punctual on occasions of the greatest moment.” -<em>The Manual of the Patriotic Volunteer on Active Service in Regular And Irregular War</em>, 1855</p></blockquote>\n<p><strong>Having a place for everything and everything in its place</strong><strong> saves time (and sometimes opportunities,<ins></ins> too).</strong> Do you know someone (perhaps yourself!) who spends ten minutes looking for his keys every single morning? Or a gent who every time he leaves the house, must turn it inside out searching for his wallet? When you have a set place for all of your possessions, you can grab them and go. You’ll never be late for a job interview, date, or other important event for a silly reason like not being able to find something you need.</p>\n<p>If you’re in the habit of haphazardly dropping things around the house, you may do so because you feel it takes too much time to put them in their proper places, or because you’re just too tired from a long day of work. But by spending and expending a minute of time and a bit of energy now, you’ll save yourself from a ten minute hunt and a lot of hassle the next day.</p>\n<p><img title=\"office\" src=\"http://content.artofmanliness.com/uploads//2012/08/office.jpeg\" alt=\"\" width=\"500\" height=\"306\"></p>\n<p><strong>Having a place for everything and everything in its place</strong> <strong>saves money.</strong> Sometimes a hunt for a lost item comes up empty –  it is never found again, forcing you to buy a replacement. You don’t have any idea what happened to it – and that’s precisely the problem. There’s no set place you keep it, so it could have ended up anywhere.</p>\n<p>Sometimes a misplaced item is eventually found – but because it was stored carelessly, it was damaged, and you still have to buy another.</p>\n<p>In <a title=\"Heading Out on Your Own — Day 24: How to Be a Savvy Consumer\" href=\"http://artofmanliness.com/2012/08/24/heading-out-on-your-own-day-24-how-to-be-a-savvy-consumer/\">our post about being a savvy consumer</a>, we mentioned that a man should not seek to own a great many things, but that those things he does possess should be of good quality. Well, once a man obtains a quality item, he must then take care of it in order to make it last. To live the principle of “a place for everything and everything in its place,” is to refuse to follow the dictums of a disposable society.</p>\n<p><strong>Having a place for everything and everything in its place will make life smoother and less stressful.</strong><strong> </strong>As we’ve mentioned a few times during this series, keeping your place in order gives you a sense of peace and confidence, and <a title=\"Willpower Part III: How to Strengthen Your Willpower and 20 Ways to Conserve It\" href=\"http://artofmanliness.com/2012/01/15/how-to-strengthen-willpower/\">conserves your willpower</a>. Being able to get out the door without first running around like a headless chicken only adds to this invaluable sense of calm and control.</p>\n<div style=\"width:573px\"><img title=\"soldier\" src=\"http://content.artofmanliness.com/uploads//2012/08/soldier.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"563\" height=\"735\"><p>“Your safety and comfort in the field will depend upon the manner in which you keep your arms and equipment. You must take particular care not to lose them, as you may not be able to replace them by the time you will need them most. Before dark, place everything where you can quickly find it in the dark. Remember that carelessness in the protection and condition of your arms and equipment may cost you your life or health, or that of a comrade.” –Army Field Manual 21-100, 1941</p></div>\n<p><strong>Having a place for everything and everything in its place prepares you for an emergency.</strong> At boot camp, members of the armed forces are rigorously drilled in strict discipline – their uniforms, beds, and lockers must all be kept just so. For a soldier, attention to little details can mean the difference between life and death. He needs to know where his equipment is every moment — an attack can come any time so he must be always ready to spring into action.</p>\n<p>While your abode may never come in for a shelling, it’s nice to know that if you ever had to run out the door quickly or jump out of bed in the middle of the night, you could dress yourself, grab what you needed, and be gone in a flash. By the way, according to ITS Tactical, <a href=\"http://www.itstactical.com/intellicom/mindset/pants-socks-boots-does-the-order-you-dress-in-really-matter/\">the proper order of dressing</a> when awakened during such a crisis is pants, socks, then shoes.</p>\n<h3><strong><span style=\"text-decoration:underline\">A Place for Everything</span></strong></h3>\n<p><img title=\"clear\" src=\"http://content.artofmanliness.com/uploads//2012/08/clear1.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"304\" height=\"410\"></p>\n<p>Now obviously, in order to have everything in its place, you have to establish the places you’re going to put your things. Your selection of places shouldn’t be done willy-nilly, either; if they’re inconvenient or ill-chosen, you won’t use them, and the habit of putting things there won’t stick. The place should be intuitive – putting your stuff in it should require the least possible thought and effort. It should be entirely natural. You’re not going to want to climb on a chair to reach a shelf to retrieve and replace something every day, for example. The place you choose to put something has to preserve the quality of the item and protect it from damage as well.</p>\n<p>Of course there are as many methods for storing things as there are different items to be stored, and every man will have his own system. Below I walk you through the possible placement of some of the most common possessions for men, as well as offer my personal suggestions on how to organize and store them.</p>\n<h3><strong>Pocket Contents</strong></h3>\n<p>We men often carry around a lot in our pockets — smartphone, wallet, pocketknife, handkerchief, keys — and so on. We need these items every day, so they should be as easy as possible to grab each morning when we head out the door.</p>\n<p><img title=\"keyhook\" src=\"http://content.artofmanliness.com/uploads//2012/08/keyhook.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"500\" height=\"354\"></p>\n<p><strong>Key hook.</strong> The minute you step through the door — keys go up on the key hook. Now this isn’t strictly necessary if you have a dresser valet/box (see below) into which you plan to deposit your keys along with the rest of the contents of your pockets when you change into your lounging wear or pajamas. But even then, if you share the car with someone else or don’t have a habit of putting your keys back into your pocket and instead tend to plop them on the counter or couch, the key hook still comes in handy. There will also be times when you want to retrieve something from your car, but don’t want to walk into your bedroom to get the keys.</p>\n<div style=\"width:510px\"><img title=\"valet\" src=\"http://content.artofmanliness.com/uploads//2012/08/valet1.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"500\" height=\"333\"><p>Put your phone, pocketknife, wallet, spare keys, etc into a dresser valet or other receptacle.</p></div>\n<p><strong>Dresser valet.</strong> Instead of dumping all of your pocket accoutrements on top of your dresser at the end of the day, depositing various items around the house, or leaving them in the pockets of the pants sitting in your hamper, place them all in a dresser valet. That way in the morning you can grab everything you need without spending ten minutes looking for your phone and keys.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B002OJ9GVE/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=B002OJ9GVE&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;tag=stucosuccess-20\">Nice dresser valets</a> with drawers and chargers for your phone and whatnot are available, but if you’re just starting out and on a budget, a $3 basket from Hobby Lobby or even a topless shoebox will do — anything that keeps your stuff together in one place will work fine and dandy.</p>\n<div style=\"width:510px\"><img title=\"banksafe\" src=\"http://content.artofmanliness.com/uploads//2012/08/banksafe.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"500\" height=\"333\"><p>Kate got me this coin bank for Christmas one year. It’s made with the door of an old post office box.</p></div>\n<p><strong>Coin bank.</strong> Coins always somehow end up in every conceivable nook and cranny in your house. So every man should have a bank in which to place his change. It’s really worthwhile to pick change up wherever you see it at home and when you’re out and about as well, and then to deposit it in your bank at the end of the day. I knew a guy who would actually throw away his pennies! Foolishness! Just save your coins for a long time, and then put them into rolls, and exchange the rolls for cash at the bank (unless they have a handy coin-counting machine you can dump your whole loose stockpile into) — you’ll be surprised how much green stuff your pocket change will amount to. There’s something so satisfying about turning your coins into cash.</p>\n<div style=\"width:510px\"><img title=\"phonewallet\" src=\"http://content.artofmanliness.com/uploads//2012/08/phonewallet1.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"500\" height=\"333\"><p>I have a wallet that also holds my iPhone. I find that keeping them together this way is quite handy.</p></div>\n<p><strong>Wallet.</strong> If you don’t keep your wallet organized, it can quickly swell to <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9sz2HDRJkUQ\">George Costanza-sized proportions</a>. An overstuffed wallet looks silly when you pull it out, is uncomfortable to carry in your pants, and makes your jacket lopsided when kept in a jacket pocket (not to mention possible back problems if you’re sitting on it all day).  A giant wallet can also create creases in your pants or jacket which can shorten the life of the garment.</p>\n<p>So clean out your wallet regularly, and only put things in it that belong there:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Keep: Cash, credit cards, ID cards, business cards, photos of loved ones</li>\n<li>Remove: Discount club membership and library cards (keep in car, or grab for a specific trip when you’ll need them), Social Security card (very risky if wallet is stolen — keep at home), condoms (can degrade in your wallet), receipts (transfer to files when you get home — see below), too many coins (unless it’s a major part of the currency in your country)</li>\n</ul>\n<p>For more about maintaining your wallet, <a href=\"http://artofmanliness.com/2012/02/14/mans-wallet-giveaway/\">see this AoM guide.</a></p>\n<h3><strong>Clothes and Accessories</strong></h3>\n<p>Clothing is an area where our best-laid plans for order often go awry: our garments frequently end up slung over chairs, tossed on the bed, crumpled in piles on the floor, and spilling out of dresser drawers.</p>\n<p>But by the same token, taking time to put away our clothes properly will go a very long way in keeping our bedrooms looking neat. Getting ready in a messy environment puts you in an out of sorts mood right from the get go, whereas waking up to a neat room in the morning really helps get your day started off on the right foot. Plus, proper care and storage of your clothes will make them last longer, saving you big money.</p>\n<p><strong>Dresser.</strong> There are a variety of ways to organize your dresser — you might choose to group clothes together by weight, season, or use. It also depends on how many drawers your particular dresser has. Here’s how I do mine:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Top drawer: underwear, socks, undershirts.</li>\n</ul>\n<div style=\"width:510px\"><img title=\"drawers\" src=\"http://content.artofmanliness.com/uploads//2012/08/drawers.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"500\" height=\"600\"><p>Drawer dividers are handy for keeping your underwear/sock drawer from becoming a chaotic mess and can help organize your others drawers as well. The expandable dividers seen here are quite handy, but a little pricey; if you’re on a budget, shoe boxes or tissue boxes from which the top panel has been removed can also work.</p></div>\n<ul>\n<li>Second drawer: Fill it with the things you reach for most. Mine has got t-shirts and workout clothes.</li>\n<li>Third Drawer: Shorts, pants, sweaters. You might also put these types of items on a shelf in your closet.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>I put my seasonal-specific clothes in a plastic tub depending on the season, and then rotate them into the dresser as the weather warms or cools.</p>\n<p>More dresser tips:</p>\n<div style=\"width:406px\"><img title=\"beforeafter\" src=\"http://content.artofmanliness.com/uploads//2012/08/beforeafter.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"396\" height=\"714\"><p>Image from <a href=\"http://www.apartmenttherapy.com/5-tips-for-organizing-dresser-136085\">Apartment Therapy</a></p></div>\n<ul>\n<li>Even when you stack your clothes into nice piles inside your dresser drawers, as soon as you pull something out that’s in the middle or bottom of the stack, the piles topple over into a mishmashed heap. A method that will keep things a bit neater is the file fold method. My drawers are too shallow for it, but it allows you to see all your garment choices and draw one out without disrupting things. If you want to give it a try, let this nice lady show you how:</li>\n</ul>\n<p><iframe src=\"http://reader.googleusercontent.com/reader/embediframe?src=http://www.youtube.com/v/nJAYRXjZoMY?version%3D3%26hl%3Den_US&amp;width=500&amp;height=281\" width=\"500\" height=\"281\"></iframe></p>\n<ul>\n<li>Twice a year, take everything out of your drawers, remove anything you haven’t worn in a year and donate those garments, then refold everything and put it back.</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>Closet rod.</strong> Some men do away with the dresser altogether, getting a little two-drawer container for socks and underwear and hanging everything else up. I’m personally kind of weirded out by t-shirts and jeans that are hung up, but to each their own. There are, however, some things that regardless of whether you have a dresser or not should be hung up, and hung up properly. The following tips will help prolong the life of your clothes, and ensure they’re ready to wear when you take them off the hanger:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>If your hang-able clothes are still clean when you take them off, put them right back on a hanger instead of leaving them crumpled up on the floor, which will create stubborn wrinkles. Hanging your worn garments will allow them to return to their natural shape.</li>\n<li>Check the garment for stains and offending scents before returning it to the hanger.</li>\n<li>Remove belts and heavy items in the pockets before placing the garment on the hanger, as they will stretch and distort it.</li>\n<li>Button the top and third button down on shirts to prevent wrinkles and the collar from spreading out on the hanger.</li>\n<li>After hanging up a suit or dress trousers you’ve worn that day, brush the garment gently with a clean, natural bristle brush. Doing this removes dirt and food that has accumulated on the outer layers before they have the chance to settle into the fabric. Regular brushing can double or even triple the time between which a garment will need to be taken to the cleaners.</li>\n<li>Never use wire hangers to hang any of your clothes. With too little surface area to properly support the garment, the wire will cut into the fabric and cause creases and damage.</li>\n<li>Use quality wood shirt hangers (at least ¼ inch thick) and wood suit hangers (at least 1+ inch thick at the shoulders) to hang up your suits and nice shirts. Quality hangers are a little pricey, but certainly worth it when it comes to prolonging the life of a $400 suit</li>\n<li>Don’t put sweaters and knit shirts on a hanger, even a wide one, as it will stretch them. Store sweaters and the like in your dresser or on a closet shelf.</li>\n<li>Don’t crowd clothes together on the closet rod — maintain at least 1/2 inch between garments for airflow and ease of selection. This will give odors a chance to dissipate, and prevent the creasing, wrinkling, and fuzz transfer that can result from garments being smooshed together.</li>\n<li>Give clothes, especially nice items like suits, a day to rest in-between wearings when possible. This will give the fabric time to release its moisture, reshape, and rejuvenate.</li>\n<li>If clothing is going to be hung for more than a couple of months without being worn, consider placing it in a breathable garment bag to prevent dust accumulation.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>For more tips on caring for your wardrobe, <a href=\"http://artofmanliness.com/2010/07/23/build-wardrobe-protect-clothing/\">see this AoM guide.</a></p>\n<p style=\"text-align:center\"><img title=\"shoes\" src=\"http://content.artofmanliness.com/uploads//2012/08/shoes1.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"200\" height=\"410\"></p>\n<p><strong>Shoe organizer.</strong> Shoes tend to get left everywhere and end up all over the house or the closet floor. We’ve all had those frustrating times where we can find one shoe, but not the other, even when we’re sure its mate must be close by! So get a shoe organizer — they come in a variety of styles from space-saving ones that hang from your closet bar, to racks that sit on the floor.</p>\n<p>Here are a couple of additional shoe storage tips:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>When you remove leather shoes, slip a <a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000H92XZE/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=B000H92XZE&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;tag=stucosuccess-20\">cedar shoe tree</a> inside them. Shoe trees maintain the shape of the shoe, prevent the leather from warping in a way that would promote premature cracking, absorb excess moisture from the soles and leather, and prolong the life of the shoes.</li>\n<li>Give your shoes a 24-hour breather between wearings when possible to allow them to shed their moisture and rejuvenate.</li>\n</ul>\n<p><img title=\"ties\" src=\"http://content.artofmanliness.com/uploads//2012/08/ties.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"500\" height=\"333\"></p>\n<p><strong>Tie rack.</strong> Ties are often made from high quality, but fragile, materials like silk. So you want to take care of them in a way that prolongs their life. That care begins with getting <a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000AEGBU4/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=B000AEGBU4&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;tag=stucosuccess-20\">a tie rack</a>. The best way to store your ties is vertically, as the gravity will naturally smooth out their wrinkles.</p>\n<p>More tie care tips:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Store knit ties by rolling them up and placing them in a box or drawer. Hanging up a knit tie will stretch it out.</li>\n<li>Always untie your tie all the way when removing it. To save time, or because they fear they won’t remember how to tie the same knot again, some men leave their ties tied, and just loosen the knot enough to slip it over their heads. The next day they slip the tie back on, and tighten it up. Don’t do this. Leaving a tie tied will damage the fabric and shorten its lifespan over time.</li>\n<li>Instead of yanking off the tie and stretching the fabric, remove it using the same steps you tied it with, only now in reverse order. This method is the gentlest way to remove a tie.</li>\n<li>As with your other nice clothes, try to give ties a day of rest between wearings, to allow them to regain their natural shape.</li>\n</ul>\n<p><img title=\"valet\" src=\"http://content.artofmanliness.com/uploads//2012/08/valet.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"250\" height=\"376\"></p>\n<p><strong>Silent valet.</strong> Also known as a “clothes valet,” or “valet stand,” these fixtures were popular with the gentlemen of yesteryear. They’re designed for the efficient man who wants his morning routine to be as smooth and stress-free as possible. Silent valets are set up to let you lay out your entire outfit for the next day the night before (and to hang up your clothes at the end of the day). They come with a place to hang your suit jacket, pants, shirt, and tie, along with a shelf for your shoes and a drawer for your pocket accoutrements. I’ve never tried one myself, but have had several readers email me about them over the years to sing their praises. If this is something that interests you, here is a plan from a 1956 issue of <em>Popular Mechanics</em> on how to build one yourself:</p>\n<p><img title=\"valet\" src=\"http://content.artofmanliness.com/uploads//2012/08/valet2.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"550\" height=\"385\"></p>\n<h3><strong>Document Box</strong></h3>\n<p>As you set up a life on your own, you’ll begin to accumulate a boat load of important documents like tax returns, college transcripts, car titles, rent leases, and credit reports. You’ll likely encounter situations where you’ll be required to cough-up these documents in order to file your taxes or to prove you’ve paid for something. You don’t want to waste hours of your life searching every nook and cranny in your apartment for a stupid piece of paper simply because you didn’t take the time to organize your paperwork.</p>\n<p>One habit I recommend starting right away is filing important paperwork in a document box (or file cabinet, if you have one). Your box doesn’t have to be anything fancy. My first document box was just a cheap plastic container you can pick up at any office supply store for $10. Now I keep most of mine and Kate’s important paperwork in a file drawer. I recently acquired a safety deposit box where I plan on putting a few of my <em>really </em>important legal documents.</p>\n<p>What sort of documents should you file away in your document box? There are seven broad categories of paperwork you should plan on keeping. Create a folder for each and start placing the suggested documents in them.</p>\n<p>Society is at a crossroads where many documents can be digitized and found online, while some things still require a hard copy. If you can digitize something, do it. But when in doubt, retain a hard copy, too.</p>\n<p><strong>Identification</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>Certified copy of your birth certificate. Your parents probably have your original birth certificate on file. Before you leave home, get your own certified copy. You’ll need it every now and then to prove your identification, like when you apply for a passport. You’ll need to contact the vital records service of the state you were born in to get your copy.</li>\n<li>Social Security card</li>\n<li>Passport</li>\n<li>Photo copy of your driver’s license</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>Insurance</strong></p>\n<p>Create a folder where you’ll store all the documents relating to the various types of insurance you may have. One folder labeled ”Insurance” should be enough when you’re first starting out. As you acquire more types of insurance, you can get more granular with your foldering. Your folder should have copies of:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Car insurance policy</li>\n<li>Health insurance policy</li>\n<li>Renter’s or home insurance</li>\n<li>Life insurance policy</li>\n<li>Disability insurance policy</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>School</strong></p>\n<p>When you’re applying for graduate programs or jobs, you’ll likely need copies of your transcripts and diplomas. Store those in a folder labeled “School.”</p>\n<p><strong>Medical</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>Immunization record</li>\n<li>List of allergies</li>\n<li>Names and numbers of doctors. When you visit a new doctor, they’ll likely call your previous doctor to get your medical records. It’s nice to have those numbers handy.</li>\n<li>Eyeglass/contacts prescription</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>Legal</strong></p>\n<p>While you might not have too many legal documents when you’re first starting out in life, it’s a good idea to create a folder for the ones you’ll likely collect throughout adulthood.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Rental leases</li>\n<li>Power of attorney</li>\n<li>Advanced directive (living will)</li>\n<li>Will (when you get one)</li>\n<li>Marriage license (when you get hitched)</li>\n<li>Any other contracts you enter into</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>Financial</strong></p>\n<p>Place all your financial related documents in this folder. These include:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Bank statements for your checking and savings account</li>\n<li>Info about your retirement savings</li>\n<li>Info about your loans</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>Warranties/Receipts/Owner’s Manuals</strong></p>\n<p>I like to have a folder where I stash all the documents for all my big purchases. Whenever one of my appliances goes kaput, I know exactly where to find the owner’s manual and receipt. Much better than searching random kitchen drawers for those things. Of course, many manuals can be found online these days, so you can go that route, although it’s still nice to have something you can easily crouch down with in the basement or something.</p>\n<p>It’s also a good idea to digitize receipts. That way if you’re out and about, you can access them anywhere, anytime on your phone.</p>\n<p><strong>Taxes</strong></p>\n<p>When you’re done filing your taxes, you need to hold onto a copy of your return and the accompanying paperwork for a few years because, 1) you might get audited by the IRS, and 2) you never know when you’ll need to report your previous year’s income for a rental agreement or loan.</p>\n<p>Create a folder for each year’s taxes. I always start mine January 1st. That’s when I begin collecting all the paperwork so I can file by April 15. After I’ve shipped everything off to the IRS, I place my folder that contains the copy of the return along with other documents in my file drawer.</p>\n<p>How long should you keep old tax files? It depends. If you’re a salaried employee working for someone else, three years should be sufficient. The IRS can audit these types of filers for any reason within a three year period. If you own a business or your taxes are more complex, hold onto your files for at least six years.</p>\n<h3><strong>Tools and Emergency Supplies</strong></h3>\n<p><img title=\"toolbox\" src=\"http://content.artofmanliness.com/uploads//2012/08/toolbox.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"463\" height=\"293\"></p>\n<p>You should also have a dedicated place where you keep all of your tools and emergency supplies — these are things you definitely don’t want to be running around hunting for when you need them! Check out these AoM guides for information on what kinds of tools and emergency equipment you should have stored carefully and at the ready:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"http://artofmanliness.com/2009/02/17/12-essential-tools-for-a-toolbox/\">12 Tools Every Man Should Have in His Toolbox</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"http://artofmanliness.com/2009/12/17/13-things-a-man-should-keep-in-his-car/\">13 Things a Man Should Keep in His Car</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"http://artofmanliness.com/wp-admin/How%20to%20Make%20a%20Bug%20Out%20Bag:%20Your%2072-Hour%20Emergency%20Evacuation%20Survival%20Kit\">How to Make a Bug Out Bag: Your 72-Hour Emergency Evacuation Survival Kit</a></li>\n</ul>\n<h3><strong>Do It Now!</strong></h3>\n<p>So you’re committed to adopting “a place for everything and everything in its place” as a maxim in your life, and you’ve established the best places to put your things. How do you now develop the habit of actually putting your things in those places?</p>\n<p>By living the principle of <strong>Do It Now!</strong></p>\n<p>Without constant, small exertions of effort, your life will always tend towards chaos. Always doing the little things that need to get done <em>right away</em> will prevent them from piling up into a giant, overwhelming mess that can get your life off track, or, at the least, add unnecessary stress to it.</p>\n<p>As soon as you’re finished using something, put it away. As soon as something you need to do crosses your mind, take care of it immediately. When you open a cabinet to get something, close it. When you run out of TP, put another roll on the holder. When you take off your clothes, put them in the hamper. When you drop something on the floor, pick it up. By living the principle of Do It Now, you can easily keep your house and life in order and live with a manly sense of peace and confidence.</p>\n<p>To illustrate the Do It Now principle, we had <a href=\"http://www.jordancrowderfilms.com/\">actor and filmmaker Jordan Crowder</a> produce an awesome video in the style of the 1950s instructional films we’ve included in a couple of the posts in this series:</p>\n<p><iframe src=\"http://reader.googleusercontent.com/reader/embediframe?src=http://www.youtube.com/v/auXMHMAZL6Y?version%3D3%26hl%3Den_US&amp;width=560&amp;height=315\" width=\"560\" height=\"315\"></iframe></p>\n<p><em>We hope you have enjoyed the “Heading Out on Your Own: 31 Basic Life Skills in 31 Days” series.

Which is why, when those who are removed a few years from their college days reminisce about that time, all they typically remember are the parties, the girls, the spring breaks, and so on.</p>\n<p>What they forget…is the <em>stress</em>.</p>\n<p>The stress of both holding down a job and being a student, the stress of stretching a meager budget each month, the stress of breaking up with someone you thought you’d spend your life with, the stress of fighting with a roommate who was once your best friend and is now your sworn enemy, and of course, the stress of cranking out a 20-page research paper and struggling to remember chemistry formulas on your final exams.</p>\n<p>Make no mistake about it: the life of a young man is often quite glorious and free, but there will also be times when you feel utterly overwhelmed. Sure, a lot of adults tend to scoff at a young man’s stress — “You think you’re busy now? Wait until you have a wife, three kids, and a full-time job!” And these men are right, in a way – your total amount of stress will tend to increase as you age and take on more responsibilities, and you’ll probably look back on college and think, “What the heck was I so worried about?” But it’s all relative, isn’t it? The stress of a young man is both unique (I wouldn’t trade the pressure of a real job for being tested on my ability to regurgitate information again) and new – you haven’t yet accumulated the life experiences that will help you see that what feels like the end of the world now, is just another bump in the road.</p>\n<p>All of which is to say, the stress you will experience after leaving home is real, and learning how to deal with it is one of the most important skills a young man can master. Since it is true that your stress will likely increase with age, learning how to manage it now will prepare you to live happily and confidently not just into your 20s, but for the rest of your life as well.</p>\n<p>With that truth in mind, today we take you through a comprehensive primer designed to help you understand what stress is, how it can negatively affect both body and mind, and how you can easily and effectively manage it.</p>\n<h3><strong>What is Stress?</strong></h3>\n<p><img title=\"stress\" src=\"http://content.artofmanliness.com/uploads//2012/08/stress.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"426\" height=\"309\"></p>\n<p><strong>Stress is your body’s reaction to circumstances in which it feels it needs more strength, stamina, and alertness in order to survive and thrive.</strong> Any perceived challenge or threat to your well-being can induce a stress response. This response signals your nervous system to release the hormones adrenaline, noradrenaline, and cortisol into your bloodstream, which gets you revved up and ready for action: your heart rate, blood pressure, sweating, and breathing increase, your blood vessels dilate to speed blood flow to your muscles, your pupils dilate to enhance your vision, and your liver releases stored glucose for your body to use as energy. In primitive times, this so-called “fight or flight” response instantly primed your body to deal with danger.<strong>  </strong></p>\n<p><strong>Thus, while many people view stress as an exclusively bad thing, it can in fact be either positive or negative.</strong> In the face of an immediate challenge — a job interview, a big presentation, a difficult test – the stress response puts you on your toes and can improve your performance and ability to handle the pressure. It also lends excitement to life; when you feel nervous butterflies before asking a girl out, or getting on a roller coaster, that’s stress too. It might seem like a 100% stress-free life would be incredible, but after a while, a state of perpetual calm would begin to feel flat, stale, and boring (at least for those of us who have not achieved total Zen!).</p>\n<p>Stress only becomes a problem in the face of two main factors. <strong>The</strong> <strong>first is stress overload.</strong> The amount of stress you feel given a certain set of circumstances is directly proportional to the degree in which you feel your skills and resources (including time) are adequate in addressing them. This state of competence can be based on either reality or one’s own optimistically or pessimistically rendered self-assessment. A man who enjoys and is talented at public speaking will feel much less stress before making a presentation than a man who is shy and speaks awkwardly; a man who completes an assignment over the course of a week will feel much less stressed than the man who waits to work on it until the night before; a man who is much less confident in dating women and what he has to offer them, will feel much more devastated when a girl dumps him than a man who has little doubt he’ll soon meet someone else. Instead of getting us revved up for action, stress that seems too big to handle can feel crushing, leaving us feeling overwhelmed and too paralyzed to do anything at all.</p>\n<p><strong>The second instance stress becomes a problem is when the set of circumstances causing it becomes chronic.</strong> The stress response was originally designed to help humans deal with <em>immediate </em>threats and challenges – after the adrenaline rush, our nervous systems quickly returned to stand-by mode in preparation for the next challenge. <em>Saber-toothed tiger! Throw spear! Tiger dead! Whoo, relax time. Me go back to making cave paintings.</em> But in modern times, our stressors can go on and on and on. As much as we might like to, we can’t spear our annoying roommate or co-worker. Instead, we have to put up with him day after day. And day after day, this chronic stress causes our bodies to dump out low levels of stress hormones. Unfortunately, a steady of dose of something that was supposed to be rare and fleeting can make us physically and emotionally sick.</p>\n<h3><strong>The Damaging Effects of Too Much Stress</strong></h3>\n<p>Too much stress can do a number on both your body and mind, causing everything from diarrhea and constipation, to tension headaches and hair loss. Below we describe more of the deleterious effects of stress:</p>\n<p><strong>Weight gain.</strong> At the height of your stress response, you will likely experience a decreased appetite. But once the stress starts to wane, the cortisol that was released into your bloodstream may spur you to eat sugary, carbohydrate-rich foods. This made sense back in primitive times: the fight or flight response usually preceded a bout of physical exertion (get that mammoth!), and after the stress had passed, it was time to replenish your body. These days, when you may experience the stress response while remaining chained to your desk, gobbling down donuts as you descend from your stress peak will only lead to a primordial-sized gut.</p>\n<p><strong>Decreased libido and erectile dysfunction. </strong>Cortisol also decreases testosterone production, which in turn can depress a man’s libido and cause erectile dysfunction. If you want to enjoy a healthy sex drive in adulthood, you’ll need to get a handle on your stress today.</p>\n<p><strong>Increased blood pressure. </strong>Cortisol, along with the other hormones that are released when we’re stressed, causes our hearts to beat faster and constrict our blood vessels in order to prime our bodies for fight or flight. Fine in the short term, but prolonged stress can lead to hypertension, and all its attending health problems.</p>\n<p><strong>Insomnia.</strong> With cortisol still pumping through your veins, even after the height of a stressful experience has passed, you may find yourself still too revved up to sleep. This inability to get some shuteye is often compounded by other factors that frequently attend stressful times — caffeine consumption, and racing, worried thoughts.</p>\n<p><strong>Hyper-emotionality. </strong>When you’re stressed and <a href=\"http://artofmanliness.com/2012/01/08/willpower-part-ii/\">your willpower is depleted</a>, you become more emotional. Hyper-emotionality doesn’t necessarily mean that you’ll become a blubbering mess at a drop of the hat, though that is a common response of individuals who are over-stressed. Rather it means that <em>all</em> your emotions – sadness, anger, even happiness — are in overdrive. With the rational part of your brain no longer in control, you’re more susceptible to outbursts of all kinds.</p>\n<p><strong>Social isolation. </strong>A common response to stress is to retreat to our “bunker” and isolate ourselves from other people. As we’ll discuss further down, while it’s certainly okay to get some alone time when you’re feeling stressed, too much isolation can actually contribute to your anxiety.</p>\n<p><strong>Poor concentration and memory. </strong>While some stress can make us more mentally nimble, chronic stress depletes our willpower and turns us into dolts. Studies show that individuals who experience stress over a long period of time demonstrate poorer concentration, decreased memory, and a reduced decision making capacity.</p>\n<p><strong>Fatigue. </strong>According to the American Psychological Association, 25% of men report experiencing physical and mental fatigue several times a week. Stress is one of the biggest contributors to that tuckered out condition. Physical tension and mental worry, along with a diminishment in testosterone, drains our bodies and makes us feel sluggish and tired.</p>\n<p><strong>Weakened immune system.</strong> You may have heard that all stress is bad for your immune system, but <a href=\"http://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2012/06/120621223525.htm\">recent studies</a> have shown that short bursts of stress can actually boost it. When your mind senses a coming crisis, stress hormones muster immune cells to potential “battlefields” in the body — tissues, organs, and mucous membranes that are particularly sensitive to infection. In primitive times, the fight of flight response was typically triggered in situations like hunting or combat where physical wounds were a likely outcome, and these immunity “soldiers” stood at the ready to stave off infection and heal these wounds as soon as they formed. But, once again, a response that was beneficial a thousand years ago has been hijacked by the ongoing stress of modern life. The constant drilling of your immunity troops in preparation for a non-existent emergency eventually wearies and weakens them, leaving you vulnerable to infections and inflammation.</p>\n<p><strong>Depression. </strong>Chronic stress reduces neurotransmitters in the brain like serotonin and dopamine, which help regulate things like appetite, energy, and sleep, in addition to balancing our moods and contributing to our sense of well-being. A diminishment of these neurotransmitters can cause depression directly, but can lead to it indirectly as well by creating a circular pattern of negative behavior. You have trouble sleeping, so you don’t feel like exercising in the morning, which makes you feel more stressed out, so you eat more, which makes you feel more sluggish, which makes you not want to go out and socialize…and on the circle spirals, potentially into depression.</p>\n<p><strong>Increased alcohol consumption, smoking, and drug use. </strong>Men tend to deal with stress by looking for an escape from it. Oftentimes, that escape is alcohol, smoking, and drugs. While many a well-balanced man won’t experience any ill-effects from a nightcap to take the edge off a stressful day, it becomes a problem when one glass turns to four. Heavy alcohol or drug use can lead to a whole host of relationship and health problems, and does nothing to mitigate the source of the stress — it may actually exacerbate it.</p>\n<h3><strong>How to Manage Stress Effectively</strong></h3>\n<p>Reading over all those stress-induced maladies may have left you feeling stressed about being stressed! But don’t worry: most stress is very manageable as long as you commit to doing the small, daily maintenance tasks that will keep your stress from reaching the point where it begins to feel crushing.</p>\n<p>As we mentioned above in the “What is Stress?” section, negative stress is generally the result of two factors: 1) Not feeling like our skills, talents, and resources (including time) are adequate to handle a threat or challenge, and 2) Chronic stress-producing circumstances that last for days, weeks, even years.</p>\n<p>Thus, when it comes to managing stress, you need to take a double-pronged approach that includes preventing these factors from occurring in the first place, and learning how to mitigate them when prevention is impossible.</p>\n<p><strong>Develop your resiliency. </strong>A huge part of dealing with stress has nothing to do with the actual stressor, but how you handle that stressor.<strong> </strong>A situation one man navigates with confident ease can cause another man to completely fall apart. Thus, the foundational block in your ability to manage stress is developing the trait of resiliency. Being resilient encompasses the way in which you both <em>act</em> and <em>react</em> in the world — your ability to both quickly bounce back from challenges and trials and to face the world head-on with courage and confidence. Without a resilient attitude and approach to life, all of the stress-reducing methods below amount to rearranging the deck chairs on the Titanic.</p>\n<p>The path to developing resilience cannot be explained in just a few sentences. Luckily, a couple of years ago, we wrote a comprehensive, 7-part series on the subject. It includes both a conceptual framework to help you understand the nature of resilience as well as practical methods to develop the trait. I really believe it’s a must-read for a man of any age. <a href=\"http://artofmanliness.com/tag/resiliency/\">You can find the series here</a>, and we also put together the articles <a href=\"http://store.artofmanliness.com/products/building-your-resiliency-ebook\">in an ebook</a> that includes worksheets as well. When it comes to dealing with stress, the articles on <a href=\"http://artofmanliness.com/2010/02/03/boosting-your-resiliency-part-2-avoiding-learned-helplessness-and-changing-your-explanatory-style/\">Avoiding Learned Helplessness and Changing Your Explanatory Style</a>, <a href=\"http://artofmanliness.com/2010/02/16/building-your-resiliency-part-iii-taking-control-of-your-life/\">Taking Control of Your Life</a>, and <a href=\"http://artofmanliness.com/2010/04/01/building-your-resilinecy-part-vi-quit-catastrophizing/\">How to Quit Catastrophizing</a> will be most applicable and helpful.</p>\n<p><strong>Exercise. </strong><span style=\"text-decoration:underline\">If you take only one stress-reducing strategy from this list, let it be this: make exercise a regular habit</span><span style=\"text-decoration:underline\">.</span> <a href=\"http://www.health.harvard.edu/newsweek/Exercise-and-Depression-report-excerpt.htm\">Researchers have found</a> that exercise is just as effective as antidepressants in treating clinical depression and <a href=\"http://well.blogs.nytimes.com/2011/02/16/phys-ed-what-really-causes-runners-high/\">increases the levels of endocannabinoid molecules</a> in our blood, the same endocannabinoids that are responsible for the calming pleasure produced by the consumption of marijuana.</p>\n<p>Exercise not only <em>treats</em> stress, it may also help <em>prevent</em> it as well; <a href=\"http://www.apa.org/helpcenter/exercise-stress.aspx\">preliminary studies</a> are beginning to show that the small amount of physical and mental stress you experience when you exercise acts sort of like an inoculation to high-stress events later, creating brain cells that are better able to deal with anxiety, or in other words, a more stress-resistant brain. If you need help in starting a regular exercise routine, <a href=\"http://artofmanliness.com/2012/08/25/heading-out-on-your-own-day-25-establish-an-exercise-routine/\">we offered some tips on the subject last week</a>.</p>\n<p>To make your exercise doubly-effective, do your workout outside, for the reasons we’ll explain next.</p>\n<p><img title=\"hiker\" src=\"http://content.artofmanliness.com/uploads//2012/08/hiker.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"328\" height=\"500\"></p>\n<p><strong>Get out in nature. </strong><a href=\"http://artofmanliness.com/2011/06/26/the-5-switches-of-manliness-nature/\">In nature, body and mind get a chance to rejuvenate</a>. In <a href=\"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19568835\">a study</a> done in Japan, researchers found that after a 20-minute walk in the forest, participants had “lower concentrations of cortisol, lower pulse rate, lower blood pressure, greater parasympathetic nerve activity, and lower sympathetic nerve activity” than subjects who spent time in the city. In layman’s terms? Walking in the woods mellows you out. In <a href=\"http://www.hphpcentral.com/article/forest-bathing\">a follow-up study</a>, time spent in nature increased feelings of vigor and decreased the feelings of anger, anxiety, and depression.</p>\n<p>So instead of spending every Saturday sacked out on the couch watching football, start making time for regular hikes in the woods. Your inner-Thoreau will thank you.</p>\n<p><strong>Meditate. </strong>Numerous studies have shown that simple mindfulness meditation can reduce and even eliminate many of the negative physiological and psychological symptoms of chronic stress. While you’re meditating, blood pressure normalizes, breathing and heart rate slows, and your adrenal glands produce less cortisol. Participants in meditation studies often report lower anxiety, worry, and tension levels. Moreover, regular meditation actually rewires your brain and makes you more resilient in the face of stress.</p>\n<p>Never meditated? <a href=\"http://artofmanliness.com/2011/09/07/a-primer-on-meditation/\">Just read our quick and handy how-to guide to get started</a>. The beauty of it is that you don’t even have to meditate that long to get the benefits. Just 20 minutes a day will do the trick, and you’ll start noticing the benefits in just a few weeks.</p>\n<p><strong>Make a list of what’s stressing you out.</strong> Sometimes when we have a bunch of things that are worrying us and a long list of things to do, all of these stressors swirl together in a big cloud of restlessness and agitation. We feel overwhelmed, but the cloud makes it hard for us to even articulate exactly why. When this happens, take some time to make a list of everything you’re worried about. Offloading them from your brain to paper will help your cranium to relax. This is, in fact, <a href=\"http://artofmanliness.com/2012/06/24/leadership-lessons-from-dwight-d-eisenhower-3-how-to-make-an-important-decision/\">one of the things Dwight D. Eisenhower did to relieve his stress</a> when the burden of deciding when to launch D-Day grew crushingly heavy.</p>\n<p>Now, make an action/to-do list by looking at each item on your worry list. Write down small, specific, immediate things you can do to take care of each stressor.</p>\n<p><strong>Get plenty of sleep. </strong>Sleep and stress create somewhat of a Catch-22 problem. Our bodies and minds need sleep to help manage and cope with stress, but stress can oftentimes prevent us from getting the sleep we need! While we could devote an entire post to how to improve your slumber, here are a few quick things you can do to get the best night’s sleep possible, even when you’re feeling tense:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Meditate twenty minutes before hitting the sack to calm and relax your mind and body.</li>\n<li>Write down all your worries before getting into bed so you’re not thinking about them while you’re trying to get to sleep. As we just mentioned, this is an effective stress-reducing tactic anytime, but it’s particularly effective right before bed.</li>\n<li>Turn off the computer and TV an hour before going to bed. The light from electronic screens suppresses the body’s natural melatonin production, a hormone which helps lull you into sleep.</li>\n<li>Speaking of melatonin, consider taking a melatonin supplement right before going to bed. It can help you relax and get to sleep quicker (and based on my experience, have crazy dreams).</li>\n<li>Make sure your room is nice and cool.<a href=\"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/8022726?ordinalpos=1&amp;itool=EntrezSystem2.PEntrez.Pubmed.Pubmed_ResultsPanel.Pubmed_DefaultReportPanel.Pubmed_RVDocSum\"> Studies show the optimal temperature for sleep is somewhere between 60 to 68 degrees</a> (brrrr!). If you don’t want to run the A/C that low all night, get a fan, keep your sleepwear light (or nonexistent), and don’t use heavy blankets or comforters.</li>\n<li>Play some white noise. White noise blocks distracting sounds as well as provides a relaxing sound that will soothe you into sleep. This can particularly help if you have night owl roommates who stay up and make noise after you’ve turned in, or if you live in the heart of a noisy city. A desktop fan is a great white noise source. Or you can download white noise soundtracks to play while you’re sleeping. I used this <a href=\"http://simplynoise.com/\">free white noise generator</a> while in law school for my power naps, speaking of which…</li>\n</ul>\n<p><img title=\"nap\" src=\"http://content.artofmanliness.com/uploads//2012/08/nap.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"400\" height=\"393\"></p>\n<p><strong>Take a nap. </strong><a href=\"http://artofmanliness.com/2011/02/07/unleash-the-power-of-the-nap/\">The simple nap is a powerful thing</a> that offers a whole host of amazing benefits, including increased alertness, a boost in your learning and working memory, and greater creativity. It’s also a potent stress-fighter: napping releases growth hormones and serotonin, which balances your cortisol, soothes your stabbiness, and leaves you feeling content and rejuvenated.</p>\n<p><strong>Reduce caffeine consumption. </strong> Caffeine increases cortisol and adrenaline production in your body, which may make you feel better in the short-term, but will increase your jagged, stressed-out feeling in the long-term. Cut back on caffeine and try to avoid it after 2PM to ensure you get a good night’s sleep.</p>\n<p><strong>Stick to a routine. </strong>The more out of control you feel, the more stressed out you’ll be. <del></del>While we can’t control everything that happens to us during the day, by taking charge of the things we <em>can </em>control, we can greatly reduce our anxiety. One way to feel more in control of your life is by establishing and sticking to routines: exercise routines, <a href=\"http://artofmanliness.com/2011/09/05/bookend-your-day-the-power-of-morning-and-evening-routines/\">morning and evening routines</a>, work routines. Anything you do frequently, try to make it routine. The more your mind knows what to expect next, the more calm and confident it will feel.</p>\n<p><strong>Plan your week. </strong>Much of the stress I experienced in college was created because I didn’t manage my time well. I’d forget due dates, wait until the last minute to write a paper, and schedule appointments that conflicted with other obligations. When I started planning my week, things markedly improved. <a href=\"http://artofmanliness.com/2012/08/05/weekly-plan/\">Having a weekly plan</a> will ensure you don’t forget important stuff or overextend your commitments like I did. Moreover, having a plan makes you feel in control, which as we just discussed, keeps stress at bay.</p>\n<p><img title=\"convo\" src=\"http://content.artofmanliness.com/uploads//2012/08/convo.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"450\" height=\"447\"></p>\n<p><strong>Get social. </strong>As I mentioned above, a common response to stress (especially for us men) is to become a hermit. I’m that way. Sometimes I just need to be alone so I can sort through stuff. While it’s perfectly fine and healthy to get some alone time when you’re stressed, if you’re still feeling frazzled after some solitude, call up a buddy or two to hang out. Studies show that social interaction does wonders for reducing stress. Our bodies release anti-stress, feel-good hormones like oxytocin when we’re around people who care for us. Plus, friends and family can offer some much needed advice and perspective that can help you manage and sort through whatever’s burdening you; while you should <a href=\"http://artofmanliness.com/2012/08/01/heading-out-on-your-own-day-1-develop-a-self-reliant-mentality/\">strive to be self-reliant</a> as much as possible, there’s no shame in calling up mom and dad when you’ve reached the end of your rope.</p>\n<p><strong>One bird at a time. </strong>I read a book a few years ago about writing by Anne Lamont that had some advice that I think is applicable to managing stress effectively. From the book <em><a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0385480016/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=0385480016&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;tag=stucosuccess-20\">Bird by Bird</a>: </em></p>\n<blockquote><p>“Thirty years ago my older brother, who was ten years old at the time, was trying to get a report on birds written that he’d had three months to write. [It] was due the next day. We were out at our family cabin in Bolinas, and he was at the kitchen table close to tears, surrounded by binder paper and pencils and unopened books on birds, immobilized by the hugeness of the task ahead. Then my father sat down beside him, put his arm around my brother’s shoulder, and said. ‘Bird by bird, buddy. Just take it bird by bird.’”</p></blockquote>\n<p>When you’re feeling overwhelmed and stressed by the things that are piling up, just take them “one bird at a time.” Instead of focusing on the enormity of everything you have to do, break things up into their component parts and do one thing at a time until you’re done. Concentrate on simply putting one foot in front of the other.</p>\n<p><strong>It will get done and over with.</strong> Something that helps me when I’m stressed out to the point where it feels like the world is going to end, is simply to tell myself, “It will get done and will be over with.” Maybe you’ll have to stay up all night to finish it, maybe what you turn in won’t be as good as it could have been, but regardless of what happens, that due date or scheduled meeting will come and go, you’ll accept the consequences, and life will move on. You can look at the clock, and think “Okay, at 3:00 pm tomorrow, this will be resolved one way or another.” For whatever reason, thinking this helps me settle down and get going on whatever I can do.</p>\n<p><strong>Start saying “NO.” </strong>A big source of stress in my life has been over-committing myself. I’d say “yes” to just about anything because, 1) I’m sort of a people pleaser, and 2) I didn’t want to miss out on any opportunity that might further my goals. After enduring the stress of managing an overbooked schedule one time too many, I’ve had to learn to say “no.” Don’t be like me. Don’t <a href=\"http://artofmanliness.com/2011/01/24/dont-should-all-over-yourself/\">should on yourself</a>, and <a href=\"http://artofmanliness.com/2010/08/29/how-to-firmly-say-no-without-coming-off-like-a-jerk/\">learn how to say “no”</a> early on in your adult life.</p>\n<h3><strong>If You’re Feeling Overwhelmed, Get Help</strong></h3>\n<p>If you’re still feeling overwhelmed after doing all that you can to manage your stress on your own, seek professional help immediately from a school counselor or therapist. Reaching out for help, especially for emotional or psychological problems, is hard for men to do. It requires us to talk about emotions and be vulnerable. Plus, we often view getting help as a sign of weakness.</p>\n<p>If you feel like you’re headed off to the deep end because of stress, don’t let the fear of looking “unmanly” keep you from getting the help you need. Men experiencing depression or chronic stress are much more likely than women to abuse alcohol, resort to violence, or attempt suicide. A trained counselor or therapist can walk you through ways to cope with your stress that don’t involve harming yourself or others.</p>\n<p>If you’re at college, go visit the student support center. They should have trained counselors that you can talk to confidentially, for free.</p>\n<p>If you’re not in college, but can’t afford a therapist, try these affordable options as suggested by <a href=\"http://www.everydayhealth.com/emotional-health/0329/ways-to-get-cheap-mental-health-care.aspx\">Everyday Health</a>:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Community mental health centers</strong>. Most states and cities have agencies that provide mental health services with trained therapists at a reduced rate. To find a community health center near you, simply Google the name of your city + “community mental health center.”</li>\n<li><strong>Non-profit mental health organizations</strong>. Two non-profit groups – National Alliance of Mental Illness and Mental Health America – have chapters throughout the country that provide affordable individual and group therapy. Visit their respective websites and find a chapter near you.</li>\n<li><strong>College psychology and therapy departments</strong>. Visit your local college campus to see if they provide discounted mental health services to the public. Many psychology and therapy departments have clinics staffed by graduate students that work with patients under the close supervision of faculty members.</li>\n<li><strong>Group therapy</strong>. Group therapy is usually much more affordable than one-on-one therapy. Do a Google search to find group therapy sessions near you that focus on stress and anxiety issues.</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong><em>What advice would you offer a young man on dealing with stress?

But there will be occasions where you’ll need to wear a nicer pair of trousers – <a title=\"Heading Out on Your Own — Day 6: How to Ace a Job Interview\" href=\"http://artofmanliness.com/2012/08/06/how-to-ace-a-job-interview/\">a job interview</a>, <a title=\"Heading Out on Your Own: Day 13 — Know How to Network\" href=\"http://artofmanliness.com/2012/08/13/networking-young-man/\">a networking event</a>, a formal church service, and, if you play your cards right, your own graduation! A nicely pressed, non-wrinkled pair of pants finishes off an outfit, and gives you a sharp, put-together look. Having your pants pressed at your local cleaners is one easy option. But for a young man who wants to save a few bucks, or is <em>pressed</em> for time, this is an important skill to know. Learning how to iron your pants yourself will make you more self-sufficient and offer a basic understanding of the clothing you put on.</p>\n<h3><strong>Why Men Do Not Iron Their Trousers</strong></h3>\n<p><strong>1. Fear of damage</strong> – Also called “The Shining” (no, not the Stephen King book).  Rather, this is what happens when trousers are ironed improperly with too high of a heat setting and the iron is pushed repeatedly across the fabric.  The fabric is molded and the weaves are compressed, resulting in a nonporous sheen that makes your trousers look cheap and reduces their lifespan.</p>\n<p><strong>2. Lack of information</strong> – Google <a title=\"Heading Out on Your Own — Day 23: How to Iron a Dress Shirt\" href=\"http://artofmanliness.com/2012/08/23/how-to-iron-shirt-a-dress-shirt/\">how to iron a dress shirt</a> and you’ll find tons of guides and videos out there.  How to press trousers?  Not so many, and half of them are providing bad advice!</p>\n<p><strong>3. They think no one notices</strong> – More than half the guys in your office don’t iron their trousers or shirts — who is going to notice, right?  Wrong — if you have ambition beyond entry-level work, <a title=\"Your Personal Appearance: The Importance of Being a Sharp Dressed Man\" href=\"http://artofmanliness.com/2008/10/30/mens-fashion-well-dressed/\">dress for the position you aspire to</a>.</p>\n<p><strong>4. They’re not even sure they should be ironed</strong> – In general, all types of pants should be ironed except cargo pants and jeans (unless you’re into the western look).  This is because of their informal nature.  Wool trousers should be pressed between dry cleanings when needed, such as after unpacking for a business trip.  Most cotton trousers, like chinos, are washed at home, and should be pulled from the dryer slightly damp. They should be ironed at this point for the easiest time pressing.  Synthetic dress slacks are often dry cleaned, although this isn’t really needed, and should be pressed between wearings, when wrinkles appear.</p>\n<p>The ironing instructions below will leave a crease down the center of the pant legs. For more casual pants like khakis, you may want to iron the pants without a crease.</p>\n<h3><strong> What You’ll Need</strong></h3>\n<ul>\n<li>Ironing board</li>\n<li>Iron</li>\n<li>Distilled or purified water</li>\n<li>Spray bottle (unnecessary if the iron has a built-in spray nozzle)</li>\n<li>Clean trousers</li>\n</ul>\n<p>For more tips on ironing boards and selecting a quality iron -<a title=\"How to Properly Iron a Dress Shirt\" href=\"http://artofmanliness.com/2011/04/06/how-to-iron-shirt/\"> click here for a classic AoM article on how to iron a dress shirt.</a></p>\n<h3><strong>Important Points</strong></h3>\n<ul>\n<li><span style=\"text-decoration:underline\">Press</span> the iron (pick it up, put it down); do not push it across the clothing<span style=\"text-decoration:underline\">.</span></li>\n<li>Examine the trousers for stains and remove the stains/dirt BEFORE ironing.  Otherwise you will have a permanent stain.</li>\n<li>Ironing time is not an exact science — but the rule should be as little time as it takes to press out the wrinkles.  Steam helps <span style=\"text-decoration:underline\">a lot</span>.  I start with 2 seconds, then modify the time depending on the fabric thickness and reaction to pressing.</li>\n<li>Ensure the iron is the <span style=\"text-decoration:underline\">correct</span> temperature for your trousers.  For example, wool can easily be damaged by too much heat.  You need to let the iron cool and make sure it is set correctly when ironing trousers after doing shirts (which are normally made from cotton and thus need a higher temperature setting).  For this reason I always recommend ironing your trousers <span style=\"text-decoration:underline\">before</span> ironing your shirts.</li>\n</ul>\n<h3><strong>Setting Up the Iron</strong></h3>\n<p>You can mostly follow manufacturer’s directions for this step, but the basics are simple:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Fill the water reservoir if there is one.</li>\n<li>Set the heat for the fabric you’re ironing — use the iron’s guide or check the tag on the trousers for the appropriate heat.</li>\n<li>Turn the iron on and let it heat up before use.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>You want a bit of steam when you’re pressing trousers, so use a steam iron, and if possible, one with a nozzle that lets you spray water as you go. If your iron doesn’t have a nozzle, keep a spray bottle handy to spray the trousers down ahead of the iron.</p>\n<h3><strong>How to Press Your Trousers</strong></h3>\n<p>I divided pressing your trousers into three parts with a total of ten steps.</p>\n<h3><strong><span style=\"text-decoration:underline\">Part I – Set-Up &amp; The Top of Your Trousers </span></strong></h3>\n<p><strong>Step 1: Double Check Your Temperature and Trouser Cleanliness</strong></p>\n<p>Check the trousers for stains or dirt and remove before ironing.  Next check the label, and ensure the iron is set for that type of fabric.</p>\n<p><img src=\"http://content.artofmanliness.com/uploads//2012/08/400-irontrousers19.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"400\" height=\"318\"></p>\n<p>When ironing a blended fabric, choose the lowest (coolest) setting of the two fabrics.  If you are ironing a 70% wool/polyester blend, you would start at 3 and maybe go up to a 4.  Lower temperatures will take longer to set a crease, but they are less likely to damage your pants.</p>\n<p><strong>Step 2: Iron the Linings of the Pockets</strong></p>\n<p><img src=\"http://content.artofmanliness.com/uploads//2012/08/400-irontrousers17.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"400\" height=\"267\"></p>\n<p>Most <a href=\"http://www.atailoredsuit.com/mens-trousers.html\"><span style=\"text-decoration:underline\">dress trousers</span></a> have inside pocket linings. Although no one will ever see these, if they are severely wrinkled and you wear your trousers close fitted, an impression of the wrinkles might be visible.  Prevent this by smoothing out the lining.  Note that linings are often made from cotton. You might have to start with a hotter temperature if you are ironing wool trousers, and then let the iron cool for 5 minutes before pressing the rest of the pants.</p>\n<p><strong>Step 3: Iron the Waistband and Top Part of the Trouser</strong></p>\n<p><img src=\"http://content.artofmanliness.com/uploads//2012/08/400-irontrousers16.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"400\" height=\"248\"></p>\n<p>Turn front pockets out and then press the iron on the top of the leg.  Lift the iron up, reinsert the pocket, and continue to <strong>press</strong> along the top of the trouser, paying special attention to pleats and re-forming any folds.  Remember, we are pressing and lifting the iron — not pushing it along the fabric.</p>\n<p><img src=\"http://content.artofmanliness.com/uploads//2012/08/400-irontrousers5.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"400\" height=\"266\"></p>\n<p>Move to the seat of the trousers, and pull out the back pockets.  <strong>Press</strong> these areas and then move up to the waistband.</p>\n<p>Finally, move to the opposite front side of the pants, turning the pocket inside out and repeating the process.</p>\n<h3><strong><span style=\"text-decoration:underline\">Part II – Pressing Your Trousers’ Creases</span></strong></h3>\n<p><strong>Step 4: Mark the Trouser Crease at the Bottom</strong></p>\n<p>Lay the trousers flat on the ironing board with the cuffs right at one end, waist draped over the far end. The waist can hang off a bit if the board is short.</p>\n<p>Flip a trouser leg up and off the board so that you’re working with just one leg, and lay it flat on the board. Look inside the cuff and find the two seams.</p>\n<p>Arrange the trouser leg so that one inseam lies right on top of the other, dead center of the flat leg. With the inseams in the center, the edges of the trouser leg are where you want to <strong>press</strong> the crease.</p>\n<p><img src=\"http://content.artofmanliness.com/uploads//2012/08/400-irontrousers11.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"400\" height=\"253\"></p>\n<p>Spray the cuff with a bit of water and <strong>press down</strong> gently on each side of the trouser leg. This should leave a visible crease at the cuff and an inch or two up the leg.</p>\n<p><strong>Step 5: Mark the Crease at the Top</strong></p>\n<p>Find the same two vertical inseams and match them up, one on top of the other, just like you did above in Step 4, but this time at the top of the pants.</p>\n<p>Lay the top of the trouser leg flat with the inseams centered.</p>\n<p>Wet the outer edge of the trouser leg and use the iron to gently press a crease into place along that edge, about six inches down from the waistband.</p>\n<p><img src=\"http://content.artofmanliness.com/uploads//2012/08/400-irontrousers8.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"400\" height=\"257\"></p>\n<p>Don’t press the crease all the way up to the waistband. The bottom of the pockets (on the inside of the trousers) is a good place to stop, or if you have pleated trousers you can just press the crease right up to the bottom of the side pleats.</p>\n<p><strong>Step 6: Press the Front Crease</strong></p>\n<p>Now that you’ve got the start and finish of the crease marked, it’s just a matter of connecting the dots.  If the inseams are still set one atop the other, the crease should be the very edge of the trouser leg as it lies flat.</p>\n<p>Press gently down in one spot with the iron. Then lift the iron, move up a bit, and do it again, <strong>always pressing straight down rather than pushing and sliding along the crease.</strong></p>\n<p><img src=\"http://content.artofmanliness.com/uploads//2012/08/400-creasing-trousers.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"400\" height=\"229\"></p>\n<p>Work all the way up from the marker at the cuff to the marker just below the pockets. It’s worth <strong>reaching inside the trouser and pulling the pocket aside so that you don’t accidentally press its shape into the trouser leg</strong> while you’re working on the crease.</p>\n<p><strong>Step 7: Press the Back Crease</strong></p>\n<p>The back crease (the one that follows the inside of your leg) should be directly opposite the front crease, also at the very edge of the trouser leg as it lies flat. Repeat the same process you used to create the front crease, again pressing straight down, gently pressing to set the crease in place, and then lifting the iron back up again.</p>\n<h3><strong><span style=\"text-decoration:underline\">Part III – Pressing Down the Leg</span></strong></h3>\n<p><strong>Step 8: Press Down the Trouser Leg</strong></p>\n<p>Once you’ve got your creases set you can press the center of the trouser leg between the creases to get out any small wrinkles or folds. Use the same motion you’ve been using: press the iron flat, pick it back up, and repeat again a little further along.</p>\n<p><img src=\"http://content.artofmanliness.com/uploads//2012/08/400-irontrousers9.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"400\" height=\"225\"></p>\n<p>If you’re worried about the trouser fabric, you can cover it with a thin, clean white cloth and press through that. In the case of delicate or napped weaves (such as <a href=\"http://www.atailoredsuit.com/gray-flannel-trousers.html\"><span style=\"text-decoration:underline\">grey flannel trousers</span></a>) a barrier helps prevent “shine,” which is the slicked-down look you get when you’ve ironed too hard or at too high of a temperature.</p>\n<p>You do not need to press both sides of the same trouser leg.</p>\n<p><strong>Step 9: Repeat for the Other Trouser Leg</strong></p>\n<p><img src=\"http://content.artofmanliness.com/uploads//2012/08/400-irontrousers10.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"400\" height=\"253\"></p>\n<p>Once you’ve pressed the creases and the leg, you’re ready to switch to the other side. Repeat the process above.</p>\n<p><strong>Step 10: Iron Seat and Front of Trousers as Needed</strong></p>\n<p>The seat and front of the trousers don’t usually need pressing the way the crease does, but if you do want to press them be sure to turn the pockets inside-out before applying the iron. You can actually slip the pants over the ironing board (as if you were putting the pants onto the board instead of your legs) to keep the front and back panels separate, allowing you to iron them one at a time.</p>\n<p>Once you’re done ironing both legs (and the rest of the trousers, if desired), be sure to hang them to let them dry completely before wearing. If you wear the trousers damp you’ll work the crease right back out, wasting all your hard work.</p>\n<h3><strong>Limitations – The Case for an Occasional Professional Pressing</strong></h3>\n<p>Trousers should be periodically pressed by a professional.  The reason is that <a href=\"http://artofmanliness.com/2009/11/05/dry_cleaning_guide/\"><span style=\"text-decoration:underline\">professional dry cleaners</span></a> have a special iron and vacuum board that uses a combination of steam being pressed in and immediately sucked out. This produces impeccably ironed pleats, which can last for a week or more worth of wearings.</p>\n<p>__________________<br>\n<em><br>\nWritten by Antonio Centeno<br>\nCreator of the <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/user/RealMenRealStyle\"><span style=\"text-decoration:underline\">Internet’s Largest Men’s Style Video Library</span></a></em></p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Related posts:<ol>\n<li><a href=\"http://artofmanliness.com/2012/08/23/how-to-iron-shirt-a-dress-shirt/\" rel=\"bookmark\" title=\"Heading Out on Your Own — Day 23: How to Iron a Dress Shirt\">Heading Out on Your Own — Day 23: How to Iron a Dress Shirt</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"http://artofmanliness.com/2011/04/06/how-to-iron-shirt/\" rel=\"bookmark\" title=\"How to Properly Iron a Dress Shirt\">How to Properly Iron a Dress Shirt</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"http://artofmanliness.com/2012/06/25/cast-iron-cooking/\" rel=\"bookmark\" title=\"Cooking with Cast Iron\">Cooking with Cast Iron</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"http://artofmanliness.com/2010/07/23/build-wardrobe-protect-clothing/\" rel=\"bookmark\" title=\"How to Build Your Wardrobe Part IV – Protecting, Storing and Cleaning your Clothing\">How to Build Your Wardrobe Part IV – Protecting, Storing and Cleaning your Clothing</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"http://artofmanliness.com/2010/12/01/iron-sharpens-iron-the-power-of-master-mind-groups/\" rel=\"bookmark\" title=\"Iron Sharpens Iron: The Power of Master Mind Groups\">Iron Sharpens Iron: The Power of Master Mind Groups</a></li>\n</ol></p><p><iframe src=\"http://feedads.g.doubleclick.net/~ah/f/f3iv4dtffn7nla1icg3h2et32g/468/60#http%3A%2F%2Fartofmanliness.com%2F2012%2F08%2F29%2Fhow-to-iron-trousers%2F\" width=\"100%\" height=\"60\" frameborder=\"0\" scrolling=\"no\" marginwidth=\"0\" marginheight=\"0\"></iframe></p><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/TheArtOfManliness/~4/5mOhkVNxB58\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\">"

There are many chores that parents have their children participate in while they’re growing up, but usually mom and dad retain exclusive control over grocery shopping. Thus, when a young man leaves home, he finds himself blinking under the fluorescent lights of the local supermarket, thousands of products stretched out before him. That first outing he may feel a little giddy as he wheels his very own shopping cart around the store, but that thrill quickly turns to dismay when he finds mid-week that even though he dropped some major coin at the register, he now has nothing to eat.</p>\n<p>Below we share some basic tips so that you can cruise the aisles of the supermarket with confidence and get the most bang for your buck.</p>\n<h3><strong><span style=\"text-decoration:underline\">Deciding Where to Shop</span></strong></h3>\n<p><img title=\"mangrocery\" src=\"http://content.artofmanliness.com/uploads//2012/08/mangrocery.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"429\" height=\"366\"></p>\n<p>Back in the old days you either made your own food or bought what you needed from the single general store in town. Now, we have almost an embarrassment of options when it comes to where to procure our food. It can be hard to sort through all those options, so below we provide their pros/cons along with a little description of each:</p>\n<h3><strong>Traditional Supermarket (Safeway, Wal-Mart Neighborhood Market, Kroger) </strong></h3>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Pros:</strong> accepts coupons, plenty of in-store specials, large selection of products, fruits and vegetables out of season, customer loyalty card discounts.</li>\n<li><strong>Cons:</strong> produce is typically trucked in from various parts of the country/world and is not as fresh, more selection can entice you to buy products you don’t need, higher prices than discount stores.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>A traditional grocery store offers one-stop convenience – you can pick up bacon, toilet paper, and shampoo in one trip. But you pay for this convenience with higher prices on things that aren’t on sale or you don’t have a coupon for. But if you shop the advertised in-store specials at straight supermarkets, you can save a fair amount.</p>\n<h3><strong>Warehouse Store (Sam’s Club, Costco)</strong></h3>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Pros:</strong> discounts on food, gas, and a wide range of products from suitcases to televisions.</li>\n<li><strong>Cons:</strong> requires a $55 annual membership fee, less product selection, you may not need such huge quantities of something, doesn’t accept coupons other than their own.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Warehouse stores offer discounts to shoppers by selling products in bulk – big pallets of toilet paper or huge jugs of soy sauce. Whether the hassle of this system and the annual membership fee required are worth it is much debated. That you can save a good deal of money on things is not in dispute; <a href=\"http://www.mrmoneymustache.com/2011/09/30/is-a-costco-membership-worth-the-cost/\">bloggers have documented it</a>. But to expand on the “cons” listed above, it’s important to mention a few caveats:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>People assume that every item at a warehouse store is the best deal in town, but this isn’t always the case. You can often get much better prices by using a coupon or taking advantage of an advertised special at a grocery store, and this is true even for things like shampoo and toilet paper.</li>\n<li>Because of the wide range of products available outside of things like food and paper goods, you can be tempted to buy things you don’t need.</li>\n<li>When you buy something in bulk, you may not be able to use it all up before it goes bad. This is an especially important consideration for the young bachelor, as he may not have room to store big pallets of stuff, and won’t be gobbling up food like a family of six.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>In general, for a young man just heading out on his own, I don’t think a warehouse store membership is beneficial. If you do get one, split it with a friend (you can share a card if you go together), and stick with buying non-perishables.</p>\n<h3><strong>Ethnic Grocery Stores</strong></h3>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Pros:</strong> unique products and cuts of meat, often cheaper prices on produce/meat/spices, fresher meats and produce.</li>\n<li><strong>Cons:</strong> narrow selection of goods, “American” products (e.g., Oreos) are more expensive.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>It can be fun to check out your local Indian, Asian, or Mexican supermarket to see the things they carry that no other store in town does. When I make carne asada, I like to go to the supermercado to get freshly made tortillas and a selection of Mexican pastries.</p>\n<p>You may have heard the urban legend that ethnic grocery stores have lower prices on items like meat and produce because they don’t have to follow the same safety standards as other establishments. But this is a misconception. The lower prices are due to the store sourcing the products more directly and cutting out the middleman.</p>\n<p>In my experience, ethnic grocery stores aren’t generally as clean as traditional ones, <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2012/06/21/opinion/lets-add-a-little-dirt-to-our-diet.html\">but maybe that isn’t such a bad thing!</a></p>\n<h3><strong>Outlet Grocery Store (local variations)</strong></h3>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Pros:</strong> big discounts on products</li>\n<li><strong>Cons:</strong> less fresh food, ever-changing selection, questionable items</li>\n</ul>\n<p>An outlet grocery store stocks what might be turned “supermarket hand-me-downs”: dented cans, products that are about to hit or have surpassed their “use by” dates, Christmas-themed cereals in July, stuff a traditional store decided not to carry anymore, and so on. You can get some great deals on these “second-rate” items, but you have to shop carefully. Dented cans and expired meat and dairy can make you sick (see below for more information about expiration dates).</p>\n<p>For those on the Eastern half of the country, Aldi is a different kind of discount grocery store to check out. While groceries at outlet stores are discounted because they’re “second-rate,” Aldi cuts prices by mainly offering only a small selection of their own decent quality house brand, only accepting cash, debt, or EBT cards (no credit cards or checks), stocking the few aisles with products still in boxes and pallets, and making you bring your own grocery bags and “rent” a shopping cart for 25 cents (you get your quarter back when you return the cart).</p>\n<h3><strong>Natural/Health/Organic Grocery Stores (Whole Foods, local natural food stores)</strong></h3>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Pros:</strong> big selection of fresh/natural/organic food+unique products+specialty health items (gluten-free, vegetarian/vegan, vitamins/supplements), cheaper bulk items like grains and spices.</li>\n<li><strong>Cons:</strong> less selection of products overall, higher prices</li>\n</ul>\n<p>While many traditional supermarkets have begun to carry a selection of natural and organic foods, natural grocery stores have a much wider array of these items and are reliable sources of things like grass-fed beef and free range chicken. At the same time, if you’re looking for Cheetos or cream of mushroom soup, you’re out of luck.</p>\n<p>Prices at health food stores are higher than traditional grocery stores, but the higher prices do (generally) net you a more natural product. And bulk items, like spices and grains, can be cheaper here.</p>\n<h3><strong>Farmer’s Market</strong></h3>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Pros:</strong> very fresh and tasty food, a chance to support local farmers.</li>\n<li><strong>Cons:</strong> higher prices, may only be held once a week, what is available changes with the seasons.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Many cities and towns hold weekly farmer’s markets where farmers in the area come and sell their produce, meat, and baked goods. It’s a fun thing to attend (<a href=\"http://artofmanliness.com/2011/07/06/10-cheap-date-ideas-shell-actually-love/\">take a date!</a>), the goods are fresh and delicious, and it’s nice to stick it to agribusiness by supporting local farmers. The pitfall is that the prices can be pretty steep.</p>\n<p>____________</p>\n<p>So there you have a rundown of your main grocery shopping options. And with these choices come more choices: many people decide to do their shopping at more than one store. For example, you might budget money to buy your meats and produce at a natural food store, while buying your staples at a discount store. Or you might shop at different traditional supermarkets each week according to which store has the best deals on what you need that week. These advertised specials can be found online and as inserts in the Sunday newspaper. Some stores like Wal-mart will match the prices of other stores’ advertised specials, and that can save you from running from store to store.</p>\n<p>Of course many folks find the convenience of getting everything they need at a one-stop-shop like Wal-Mart outweighs any other factor.</p>\n<p>There are other things to consider as well:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>By driving around to more than one store to score a deal, will I negate the savings with the gas I burn?</li>\n<li>Is a store’s reputation for how they treat their employees important to me?</li>\n<li>If I shop at a big discount store, will I be tempted to buy more than I need, negating the savings? I don’t think this is considered enough. I’ve lately been doing most of my grocery shopping at a small natural foods store. Not because I have money to burn, but because I found that I spent about the same shopping there as when I went to Wal-Mart. When shopping at the latter, I’d always end up making unplanned purchases of junk or packaged food (oh cool, PF Changs in a bag) while at the natural food store, the selection is a lot smaller, I buy less packaged food, and I find it easier to stick to my list, so that while the prices are more expensive, I purchase less overall, and the bill comes out about the same.</li>\n</ul>\n<h3><strong><span style=\"text-decoration:underline\">Tips for Grocery Shopping Like a Pro</span></strong></h3>\n<p><strong>Always go with a list. </strong>To save time and money, always, always create a shopping list before you head to the store, and stick to it religiously. Studies done by the grocery industry have shown that 60 to 70 percent of purchases at the grocery store are unplanned. That pretty much fits my experience. I remember when I first started shopping for myself, I’d just grab things from displays that looked tasty and interesting. This wasn’t good for either my waistline or my wallet.</p>\n<p>Here’s how to create your shopping list:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Begin by planning out your weekly menu and then putting the needed ingredients on your list.</li>\n<li>After you’ve written the items for your menu, do a quick check on your staples. How’s the milk/egg/bread supply? Do you need more paper towels or tin foil? How are you doing on TP? If you feel like there’s something you need, but you can’t think of it, run through your daily routine in your mind to jog your memory (first I brush my teeth, then I floss, then I get in the shower, then I wash my hair – oh shampoo! – that’s what I needed.) Add needed items.</li>\n<li>Now take your rough list, and create a master list that will make your shopping trip more efficient by grouping items together that are together at the store. Here’s an example:</li>\n</ol>\n<div style=\"width:510px\"><img title=\"list\" src=\"http://content.artofmanliness.com/uploads//2012/08/list1.jpeg\" alt=\"\" width=\"500\" height=\"607\"><p>By grouping items on your list together that are found together at the store, you’ll avoid getting to the far side of the store, and then realizing you forgot something on the other side where you came in. You’ll need to get familiar with the layout of your grocery store to do this, but the effort is well worth it as it saves you time and hassle.</p></div>\n<p><strong>Check the unit price to get the best deal. </strong>Instead of simply looking at the overall price when deciding which product to buy, look at the unit price. The unit price tells you the price per pound, ounce, liter, etc. of a product.</p>\n<p>Many stores have the unit price right on the shelf label, but it’s usually smaller and more discrete than the total price. Here’s a picture of Wal-Mart’s price labels with the unit price pointed out:</p>\n<p><img title=\"IMG_0548\" src=\"http://content.artofmanliness.com/uploads//2012/08/IMG_0548.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"450\" height=\"298\"></p>\n<p>If your store doesn’t display the unit price, you can figure it out yourself by simply dividing the price by the number of pounds/ounces/etc. in the package. For example, the unit price for a 10-pound package of flour costing $5.00 is $.50 a pound ($5/10 lbs = $.50).</p>\n<p>Breaking a product’s price down like this allows you to better compare prices of different items. This is especially important when different brands package the same product in different quantities. In an effort to maximize profits, companies will package and price items in such a way that you’ll actually buy the more expensive item on a unit price basis. For example, consumers often intuitively think that if they buy the biggest box on the shelf, they’ll get the lowest unit price. For the most part that’s true, but not always, so it’s worth it to double check.</p>\n<p>Some items have what’s called a <em>quantity surcharge. </em>Grocery stores will often jack up the price on products in large-sized packages, driving the unit price up. Buying the single serving or smaller sized package can actually be the better deal if a larger product has a quantity surcharge. This happens a lot with cereals, so make sure to compare before you decide to buy the big-ol’ three-pound box of Cinnamon Toast Crunch.</p>\n<p><strong>Go with generic brands when you can.</strong> As we discussed in our post on <a href=\"http://artofmanliness.com/2012/08/24/heading-out-on-your-own-day-24-how-to-be-a-savvy-consumer/\">being a savvy consumer</a>, generic products can be hit or miss. Many are manufactured in the same factory as the brand name product and simply given a different label. They’re discounted because they don’t have to spend money on advertising to maintain “brand awareness.” Other times, a generic is cheaper because it’s not made as well. So just do some experimenting. I always buy the generic first, and only switch if I’m dissatisfied with it.</p>\n<p><strong>Skip coupons. </strong>Now this is just my opinion. Plenty of people are super into couponing and think it’s the bees knees and extremely worthwhile. Personally,<strong> </strong>I’ve tried couponing, but the payoff was never worth the time and effort. Most of the coupons you’ll find in the Sunday paper are for crap food like Dunk-a-roos and Juicy Juice boxes; it was rarely for stuff I’d buy anyway. We have to remember that coupons aren’t printed because food manufacturers want to help out our budget. Coupons are a marketing strategy to get consumers to purchase something they wouldn’t buy in the first place. I’ve also noticed that coupons get issued for stuff that’s already overpriced to begin with. I can save 15 minutes of my time and save the same amount of money buying the generic brand versus clipping a coupon for the name brand. Or I simply choose the brand that the store is running a special on.</p>\n<div style=\"width:279px\"><img title=\"00000807\" src=\"http://content.artofmanliness.com/uploads//2012/08/00000807.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"269\" height=\"510\"><p>Shoppers gonna shop</p></div>\n<p><strong>Shop on a full stomach. </strong>To save money, never shop on an empty stomach. <a href=\"http://www.psychologytoday.com/blog/the-science-willpower/201107/the-neurobiology-dont-shop-when-youre-hungry\">Studies show that when shoppers visit the grocery store hungry, they usually end up spending more money on food</a>. So go shopping after you’ve eaten a meal, when possible. If your schedule doesn’t permit that, at least have a small snack before hitting the supermarket.</p>\n<p><strong>Understand the difference between “sell by,” “use by,” and “best by.”</strong> It’s easy to notice that most food products come with dates stamped on them. But what’s the difference between “sell by” and “use by”? I honestly didn’t know myself until writing this article! But it’s a good bit of knowledge to file away as it can help you make purchasing decisions, figure out whether a bargain at a grocery outlet store is a good deal or might make you sick, and prevent you from throwing away perfectly good food (and money).</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Best by.</strong> Often found on shelf-stable products, the “best by” stamp is not a safety rating, but indicates the point up until which the product will offer the best quality and flavor. After that date, the texture and taste may change, but it can still be safe to consume.</li>\n<li><strong>Sell by.</strong> Perishables like meat, dairy, and bakery goods are frequently given a “sell by” stamp. This label tells the store how long to display an item on their shelves. You should always buy a “sell by” item before the date given, but it’s not a safety indicator, and the product may still be good for days or weeks after you bring it home and the date has expired, as long as you store it properly.</li>\n<li><strong>Use by.</strong> “Use by” is the only designation that indicates that the product may no longer be safe after that date. It is actually used more often as a “best by” label, but since these products can spoil faster than others, always consume a “use by” product on or before that date to be on the safe side. When buying a “use-by” product, make sure you’ll have time to consume it before the date given.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>When it comes to perishables like milk, always reach to the back of a shelf to grab a carton; the store will put products which are closer to reaching their “sell by” date up at the front of a shelf or on the top of a stack while the fresher ones will be in the back or on the bottom.</p>\n<p>Once you bring a product home, cook a “use by” product on or before the date given, and store “sell-by” perishables at 40 degrees or below and “best by” items in a cool, dry cabinet.</p>\n<p>To figure out how long you can store a “sell by” or “best by” item (or an item without a date), before you have to cook, consume, or freeze it, consult a <a href=\"http://www.stilltasty.com/searchitems/search_page\">“keep it or toss it” database</a>. The answers may surprise you — for example, did you know you can keep eggs for 3-5 <em>weeks</em> after the date on the package? Checking dates can prevent you from throwing away a ton of food! (But always look at the appearance of an item and give it a sniff for spoilage, too, before consuming!)</p>\n<h3><strong>How to Check If Produce Is Ripe</strong></h3>\n<p>Picking produce is tricky. You don’t want to buy fruits and vegetables that are too ripe (if you buy them and don’t eat them right away, they’ll go to waste), nor do you want them to be so under-ripe that you’ll have to wait a few days before you can eat them.</p>\n<p>For the first few years of my adult life, I had no idea how to pick fresh produce. I’d go to the produce section and sort of “ape” what I saw my mom do when I went to the grocery store with her as a boy. I’d pick fruits and vegetables up to squeeze and smell them. The entire time, however, I would be thinking, “I have no clue what I’m doing.”</p>\n<p>After several trips of me mindlessly fondling the produce, I finally did some research on what I should actually be looking for when selecting it.</p>\n<p><strong>Picking Ripe Fruit</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>See it.</strong> For some fruits like apples, bananas, and tomatoes, you can tell it’s ripe simply by looking at its color. If you don’t plan on using the fruit for a while, it’s a good idea to buy it green at the store so it has time to ripen up at home. Avoid fruits with dark spots or bruises, which indicate the fruit has been damaged.</li>\n<li><strong>Squeeze it. </strong>As fruit ripens, the substances that hold the cells together break down and convert to water-soluble pectins, which make the fruit become softer and softer. Thus, a soft squeeze is a good test for ripeness. You want the flesh of the fruit to be firm, but give a little bit to the touch. If it’s rock hard, it’s not ripe; if it’s mushy, it’s over-ripe. The squeeze test is useful on fruits like peaches, pears, plums, avocados, and kiwis. It’s not as helpful on fruits with thick rinds like melons and pineapples. Although if you feel like giving your pineapple a gentle, loving squeeze, that’s your prerogative.</li>\n<li><strong>Smell it. </strong>Chemical changes take place in ripening fruits that produce fruity smells. Sniff the blossom end of the fruit (the end opposite of the stem). You’re looking for a light, sweet smell. If it smells sour or overly fruity, it’s probably over-ripe.</li>\n<li><strong>Heft it. </strong>Juiciness is an important attribute for fruits like watermelons, cantaloupe, and tomatoes. To ensure you get the juiciest piece of fruit, pick it up in your hand and heft it. The heavier the fruit, the juicier it’s likely to be.</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong> Picking Ripe Vegetables </strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>See it. </strong>Look for vegetables that are evenly colored. You want leafy greens that are dark in color. The darker the leaf, the more flavor they have. Some brown spots on lettuce and kale should be expected, but overall they should be nice and green. If a vegetable looks wilted, pass it over.</li>\n<li><strong>Squeeze it. </strong>Unlike fruit, you want vegetables to be as firm as possible. Vegetables that are wilted and soft just aren’t very appetizing. Broccoli, potatoes, carrots, cucumbers, onions, peppers, and cauliflower should all be firm to the touch. Leafy greens like lettuce, kale, and cabbage should snap with a nice crisp sound.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>For more info on selecting vegetables, check out this <a href=\"http://whatscookingamerica.net/Vegetables/VegetableBuyingGuide.htm\">handy guide</a>.</p>\n<p><em><strong>Where do you like to shop for groceries?

I had football coaches who took care of that for me. I just had to show up at the weight room at the designated time with the rest of my teammates and do the scheduled workout. Because of that consistency, along with a lot of hard work, I was in really good shape when I graduated and headed off to college.</p>\n<p>With my football days behind me, I pretty much stopped working out once I arrived on campus. I’d play the occasional pick-up basketball game, but I didn’t have a set fitness routine to maintain the strength and conditioning I achieved while in high school. Boy, did things deteriorate quickly for me. I started to get soft and pudgy and my strength was nowhere near the levels I was used to. I remember one night during my freshman year in college I decided to go to the gym in an attempt to get back on track. I slapped 225 lbs on the bench barbell to start off. It was a weight I had easily lifted in high school. I lifted the barbell off the rack and began to slowly lower it to my chest…where it stayed until my cries of help were heard. Thankfully, only my ego was bruised. But that moment really spurred me to get back on the fitness bandwagon.</p>\n<p>I’ve noticed that a lot of young men heading out on their own fall into the same trap I did. Sometimes they were physically active in high school because of sports, but as soon as they head off to college they stop exercising completely and quickly become the stereotypical fat ex-jock. Don’t let this happen to you! It’s harder to get back into shape once you’ve gotten flabby than it is to maintain the shape you’re already in. That’s why it’s so important you keep a regular exercise routine when you head out on your own.</p>\n<p>If you didn’t exercise regularly in high school, without working out (and a healthy diet) you won’t become a fat ex-jock, you’ll just become fat. Plenty of guys who maintained an average weight in college find themselves growing a belly as they move into their mid and late 20s — a diet of fast food and plenty of beer takes its toll.</p>\n<p>When I went with Kate to her ten year high school reunion, I was struck by the fact that while most of the women seemed to have maintained their figures (despite some of them having children), the dudes looked pretty out of shape and overweight.</p>\n<p>The first few years living out on your own will a build a foundation for the rest of your life, so unless you want to become the middle-aged guy who gets all wheezy when playing with his kids, <em>now</em> is the time to establish a fitness routine for yourself.</p>\n<h3><strong>Why You Need a Fitness Routine</strong></h3>\n<p><strong>Increases testosterone. </strong>Testosterone is what makes men, men. Unfortunately, most young men have lower testosterone than their grandfathers did because of changes in diet, activity levels, and chemicals in our environment, water, and food supply. The <a href=\"http://artofmanliness.com/2009/06/03/30-days-to-a-better-man-day-4-increase-your-testosterone/\">benefits of optimal testosterone levels</a> are numerous. Besides increasing your libido, testosterone does the following:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>increases mental and physical energy</li>\n<li>boosts happiness (men with low-T often suffer depression)</li>\n<li>increases competitive drive</li>\n<li>helps prevent Alzheimer’s and dementia</li>\n<li>increases muscle size and strength</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Compound weight lifting exercises like squats, bench press, cleans, and deadlifts are great testosterone boosters. High intensity exercises, like sprinting, have been shown to boost testosterone levels as well.</p>\n<p><strong>Good for your brain. </strong>If you want to be a stellar college student, you need to hit the treadmill in addition to hitting the books. <a href=\"http://www.livescience.com/6340-exercise-good-brain.html\">Studies show that regular exercise speeds learning, improves memory, and promotes clearer thinking. </a></p>\n<p><strong>Increases your willpower. </strong><a title=\"Willpower Part I: The Force of Greatness\" href=\"http://artofmanliness.com/2012/01/01/willpower/\">We’ve talked about the importance of willpower in our success as men.</a> One way to strengthen it is to make regular exercise a habit. Working out will increase your discipline in all areas of your life.</p>\n<p><strong>Reduced health costs. </strong>Health costs are ballooning here in the U.S. because of the rise of obesity and obesity-related diseases like diabetes, heart disease, and hypertension. While proper diet plays the biggest role in preventing obesity, regular exercise can help stave off weight gain and improve how your body uses insulin so you don’t get diabetes. A regular fitness routine has also been shown to reduce blood pressure and improve heart health. If you don’t want to spend a small fortune treating these ailments in the future, get in the gym today. Not only will you reduce your own health care costs by being physically fit, you can take some manly pride knowing you’re not increasing costs for your neighbors and fellow citizens.</p>\n<p><strong>Relieves stress and depression. </strong>We’re going to go into more detail about managing stress next week, but one thing you can start doing today that will go a long way to keeping you chill like The Dude is to exercise. It releases endorphins in your brain, improves sleep, and can relieve feelings of <a href=\"http://well.blogs.nytimes.com/2009/11/18/phys-ed-why-exercise-makes-you-less-anxious/\">anxiety</a> and <a href=\"http://www.health.harvard.edu/newsweek/Exercise-and-Depression-report-excerpt.htm\">depression</a>. Exercising regularly is truly one of the most important things you can do to stay sane during college.</p>\n<p><strong>Makes you physically attractive. </strong>Your physical attractiveness can play a big role in your personal and professional success. Women are more attracted to men who are fit and in shape. Men who are physically attractive often report <a href=\"http://online.wsj.com/article/SB10001424052970203687504576655331418204842.html\">higher incomes and more job promotions</a> than men who are less attractive. Exercise can help mold a physique that will make you attractive to others, and even more importantly, boost your confidence in yourself.</p>\n<h3><strong>Establishing an Exercise Routine</strong></h3>\n<p><img title=\"push\" src=\"http://content.artofmanliness.com/uploads//2012/08/push.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"500\" height=\"292\"></p>\n<p>A lot of men know it’s important to exercise, but end up feeling lost as to what to do for their workout. There are so many opinions out there as to what the “best” workout is that you can end up feeling overwhelmed and not doing anything at all. When I’d go to the gym at OU, I’d often see guys just kind of wandering around aimlessly, half-hardheartedly doing a few bicep curls and tricep extensions.</p>\n<p>In truth, at least in my opinion, unless your fitness goal is to get super shredded or have a bodybuilder’s physique, you shouldn’t stress about finding the “perfect” workout. Instead, focus on improving your overall strength and fitness with a routine that’s as simple as possible – one you will enjoy and do consistently. The most important thing is to do something, <em>anything</em>, to move your body every day!</p>\n<p>Below I suggest two exercise routines that are perfect for a young man who is busy, but is looking to maximize results. One requires access to a gym and free-weights, while the other consists solely of bodyweight exercises.</p>\n<h3><strong>StrongLifts 5×5 Workout</strong></h3>\n<p>My favorite workout routine is the <a href=\"http://stronglifts.com/stronglifts-5x5-beginner-strength-training-program/\">StrongLifts 5×5 routine</a> promoted by a guy named Mehdi in Belgium. It’s fast (workouts take about 40 minutes), you don’t need much equipment, it produces great results, and it’s very doable for a beginner who’s new to lifting. I also like it because it’s similar to the strength training program I did as a high school football player. I’m stronger and leaner than I’ve ever been since starting Mehdi’s StrongLifts program.</p>\n<p>The program is simple. There are two workouts (A &amp; B), each consisting of five exercises:</p>\n<p><strong>Workout A</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>Squat (5 sets of 5 reps)</li>\n<li>Bench Press (5 sets of 5 reps)</li>\n<li>Inverted Rows (3 sets of as many reps as you can perform in each set until muscle failure)</li>\n<li>Push-ups (3 sets until failure)</li>\n<li>Reverse Crunch (3 sets of 12 reps)</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>Workout B</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>Squat (5 sets of 5 reps)</li>\n<li>Overhead Press (5 sets of 5 reps)</li>\n<li>Deadlift (1 set of 5 reps)</li>\n<li>Pull-ups/Chin-ups (3 sets until failure)</li>\n<li>Prone Bridges (3 sets each set lasting 30 seconds)</li>\n</ul>\n<p>You do 5 sets of 5 (1 set of 5 on the deadlift) using the same weight throughout the exercise, e.g., if your first set on the bench press is 135 lbs, your last set should be 135 lbs, too. I rest two minutes between each set.</p>\n<p>Every other day, you alternate workout A &amp; B. Once a week, give yourself a break from lifting for 48 hours.</p>\n<p>So for example, my schedule using StrongLifts 5×5 looks like this:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Monday: <strong>Workout A</strong></li>\n<li>Tuesday:  Sprints</li>\n<li>Wednesday: <strong>Workout B</strong></li>\n<li>Thursday: Long distance run</li>\n<li>Friday: <strong>Workout A</strong></li>\n<li>Saturday: Rest (I usually take a nice walk)</li>\n<li>Sunday: Rest</li>\n</ul>\n<p>The following week, I start off with workout B:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Monday: <strong>Workout B</strong></li>\n<li>Tuesday: Plyometrics</li>\n<li>Wednesday:  <strong>Workout A</strong></li>\n<li>Thursday: Long distance run</li>\n<li>Friday: <strong>Workout B</strong></li>\n<li>Saturday: Rest</li>\n<li>Sunday: Rest</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Every workout, add 5 lbs to the weight you lifted in the previous session. If you ever reach a plateau, reduce your weight by 10% and start slowly adding 5 lbs again until you break through it.</p>\n<p>That’s the basics of the program. I highly recommend that you <a href=\"http://stronglifts.com/free-stronglifts-5x5-report/\">download Mehdi’s free ebook</a> to get a more comprehensive and detailed look at the workout. The ebook includes links to instructions on how to do the exercises, some nice spreadsheets you can use to track your progress, and other helpful info on how to get started with StrongLifts 5×5. Also, take some time to peruse <a href=\"http://stronglifts.com/\">his website</a> for even more information. (I have zero affiliation with Medhi, by the way; this is honestly the program I use myself and have gotten good results from.)</p>\n<p>On the days I’m not doing the 5×5 program (Tuesdays and Thursdays), I do my cardio workouts:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Tuesdays:</strong> Sprints or plyometrics. For my sprint workouts I go to the middle school football field near my house and mark off 40 yards with some cones. I’ll warm up with a jog around the football field with some dynamic warm-ups mixed in. I’ll then do 40 sets of full-out 40 yard sprints, resting about a minute between each sprint. I’m starting to add one sprint to every workout. This is High Intensity Training (HIT), which is super effective at boosting your aerobic capacity, lowering blood sugar levels, and burning fat. For my plyometrics workout I follow <a title=\"Beginner’s Guide to Plyometrics\" href=\"http://artofmanliness.com/2010/05/21/beginners-guide-to-plyometrics/\">the program I wrote about a few years ago.</a></li>\n<li><strong>Thursdays:</strong> Long distance run (well, long distance for me). I usually do a 5k, and I use the NikeRun app to track my progress. I make sure my course has some challenging hills.</li>\n</ul>\n<h3><strong>Bodyweight Workout</strong></h3>\n<p>This bodyweight program is one I do sometimes when I can’t or don’t want to go to the gym. It works your entire body and can be done anywhere. The only equipment this routine requires is an <a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001EJMS6K/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=B001EJMS6K&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;tag=stucosuccess-20\">Iron Gym Pull-Up Bar</a> that you can place in any doorframe and which doesn’t require you to drill any holes. Even if you plan on going to the gym regularly, buying an Iron Gym Pull-Up Bar is a great investment for any young man. Make it a policy to crank out a few pull-ups each time you pass through the doorframe from which it hangs.</p>\n<p>Even if you can’t swing an Iron Gym bar, I’m sure you could find a tree branch or another bar that could be used for pull-ups. Or you can sub in a bodyweight row. Let <a href=\"http://www.nerdfitness.com/blog/\">Steve Kamb from Nerd Fitness</a> show you how (he’s got great <a href=\"http://www.nerdfitness.com/blog/2009/12/09/beginner-body-weight-workout-burn-fat-build-muscle/\">beginner</a> and <a href=\"http://www.nerdfitness.com/blog/2009/12/17/advanced-body-weight-workout-warning-this-will-kick-your-ass/\">advanced </a>bodyweight workouts on his site for more ideas too):</p>\n<p><iframe src=\"http://reader.googleusercontent.com/reader/embediframe?src=http://www.youtube.com/v/OYUxXMGVuuU?version%3D3%26hl%3Den_US&amp;width=500&amp;height=281\" width=\"500\" height=\"281\"></iframe></p>\n<p>This is a circuit program, meaning you do each of the exercises back-to-back without any rest. When you’ve completed all the exercises, you’ve completed one circuit. The exercises link to how-to videos for those who haven’t done them before.</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong><a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R1v152b72lo\">Squats</a>:</strong> 20 reps</li>\n<li><strong><a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eh00_rniF8E\">Push-ups</a>: </strong>10 reps</li>\n<li><strong><a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H6tf2rr3iwY\">Hindu push-ups</a>:</strong> 10 reps</li>\n<li><strong><a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rziYBKhDztI\">Walking Lunges</a>:</strong> 20 reps</li>\n<li><strong><a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HQa7iV9sE_w\">Pull-ups</a>:</strong> 5 reps</li>\n<li><strong><a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p69wH3KH-P0\">Dips</a>:</strong> 15 reps</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Do a ten minute warm-up first (jumping jacks, jump rope, jogging), and then complete each exercise back-to-back without resting. That’s a circuit. Rest for two minutes after completing a circuit and then start another one.</p>\n<p>Start with one circuit, and then add a circuit once you’re able to perform all the reps for all the exercises. Keep adding circuits until you can complete all the reps for all the exercises for five circuits. After that, start adding 1 rep to each exercise at each workout.</p>\n<p>Perform this workout every other day, three times a week. Here’s a suggested schedule:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Monday:</strong> Bodyweight workout</li>\n<li><strong>Tuesday:</strong> Sprints or plyometrics</li>\n<li><strong>Wednesday:</strong> Bodyweight workout</li>\n<li><strong>Thursday:</strong> 5K run</li>\n<li><strong>Friday:</strong> Bodyweight workout</li>\n<li><strong>Saturday:</strong> Rest</li>\n<li><strong>Sunday:</strong> Rest</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Whatever workout program you choose, the key is to be consistent with it. Treat your workouts like an important doctor’s appointment. When you <a href=\"http://artofmanliness.com/2012/08/05/weekly-plan/\">plan your week</a>, block off a time each day for exercise.</p>\n<p>You should also look for ways to incorporate exercise into your everyday life – walk and bike to campus when you can, join an intramural team, play some pick-up games of ultimate Frisbee with your buds, and take a date on a bike ride. Establishing a habit of regular exercise – both at the gym and throughout your day — will reap enormous benefits for the rest of your life.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Related posts:<ol>\n<li><a href=\"http://artofmanliness.com/2008/01/08/every-man-every-day-should-do-these-exercises/\" rel=\"bookmark\" title=\"Every Man Should Do This Exercise Routine Every Day\">Every Man Should Do This Exercise Routine Every Day</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"http://artofmanliness.com/2011/05/05/hero-training-the-leaping-ability-workout/\" rel=\"bookmark\" title=\"Hero Training: The Leaping Ability Workout\">Hero Training: The Leaping Ability Workout</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"http://artofmanliness.com/2008/01/17/get-bigger-stronger-with-strongliftscom/\" rel=\"bookmark\" title=\"Get Bigger And Stronger with Stronglifts.com\">Get Bigger And Stronger with Stronglifts.com</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"http://artofmanliness.com/2010/01/27/the-burpee-the-one-exercise-to-rule-them-all/\" rel=\"bookmark\" title=\"The Burpee: The One Exercise to Rule Them All\">The Burpee: The One Exercise to Rule Them All</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"http://artofmanliness.com/2012/08/14/heading-out-on-your-own-day-14-establish-a-simple-cleaning-routine-and-stick-to-it/\" rel=\"bookmark\" title=\"Heading Out on Your Own — Day 14: Establish a Simple Cleaning Routine and Stick to It\">Heading Out on Your Own — Day 14: Establish a Simple Cleaning Routine and Stick to It</a></li>\n</ol></p><p><iframe src=\"http://feedads.g.doubleclick.net/~ah/f/f3iv4dtffn7nla1icg3h2et32g/300/250?ca=1&amp;fh=280#http%3A%2F%2Fartofmanliness.com%2F2012%2F08%2F25%2Fheading-out-on-your-own-day-25-establish-an-exercise-routine%2F\" width=\"100%\" height=\"280\" frameborder=\"0\" scrolling=\"no\" marginwidth=\"0\" marginheight=\"0\"></iframe></p><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/TheArtOfManliness/~4/I3gi93UetMw\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\">"

But <em>less </em>doesn’t mean <em>nothing</em>. <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iYJKd0rkKss\">Unless you’re Dick Proenneke</a>, you’re going to spend most of your life as a consumer of goods and services like cars, clothes, healthcare, and even your education.</p>\n<p>Never in human history have there been so many choices as to what to spend your money on. And never have marketing tactics to get you to buy those things been so sophisticated. Every time you swipe a store loyalty card, use your smart phone, log into Facebook, or surf the net, companies are mining this data, gathering information on your address, family size, education and income level, favorite books, movies, and hobbies, and history of purchasing behavior. This data is then fed into complex algorithms that craft ways to target you with ads and mailings pitched to your specific hopes, dreams, and insecurities. Corporations have you in their sights.</p>\n<p>Now, I don’t want to paint too sinister a face on it – companies are simply offering products and services that people want – but to the degree that marketers track you, they are essentially “predators” on the hunt. They don’t want to eat you, certainly (you’re much more valuable alive!), they just want to burrow into your mind and get you to buy their stuff. They’ve got millions of dollars and sophisticated tools at their disposal, so the playing field is far from level, but as the “prey,” you can definitely put up a fight. You need to be educated and empowered, an informed consumer who doesn’t buy mindlessly on impulse and end up with a house full of useless or non-functioning junk and a mountain of debt. The informed consumer makes his purchases on his terms and does his homework to make sure he doesn’t get ripped off, receives the most bang for his buck, and only buys what he truly wants and needs.</p>\n<h3><strong>Understand the Principle of Value vs. Price</strong></h3>\n<p>A few years ago, <a href=\"http://artofmanliness.com/2010/03/01/art-of-manliness-group-writing-project-lessons-in-manliness/\">we did a project</a> where we asked AoM readers to write up “Lessons in Manliness” profiles on the ordinary men in our lives, describing how these mentors embodied manliness and inspired us. We then compiled these profiles into <a href=\"http://content.artofmanliness.com.s3.amazonaws.com/lessonsinmanliness10.pdf\">a free ebook.</a></p>\n<p>Something that I remember really striking me at the time was how many of the profiles mentioned that the man in question always made purchases based on the quality of a product rather than simply its price. When making a purchasing decision, they looked for things that would last.</p>\n<p>My grandfather was this kind of consumer, and yours probably was (or is) too. He 1) Didn’t care about amassing a lot of possessions, but wanted the possessions he did have to do their job and bring him enjoyment, and 2) he understood that just because something was <em>cheap</em>, didn’t make it a <em>bargain</em>. To figure out the true value of something, he looked beyond the sticker price, to the <em>price per use.</em></p>\n<p><strong>Gauging Price per Use</strong></p>\n<p>Let’s start with the example of a leather briefcase. Bob shops on price and buys a nylon messenger bag for $50. Frank, however, buys a leather briefcase with a lifetime warranty for $500. They each use their respective bags 200 times a year. Bob’s cheap bag wears out after three years and he has to replace it. Frank’s leather bag lasts 50 years, and he hands it down to his grandson. In Bob’s case the price per use on his bag was about 8 cents (200 uses a year X 3 years divided into $50). For Frank, his cost per use is 5 cents, which will only go down as his grandson continues to use the bag. So ultimately, while Bob’s bag was initially a whole lot cheaper, in the long run Frank’s purchase will turn out to be the better deal.</p>\n<p>Something that will also affect this equation is how often you use the product. As <a href=\"http://artofmanliness.com/2012/06/08/so-you-want-my-job-outdoor-shop-owner/\">Darren pointed out in his truly excellent So You Want My Job interview on being the owner of an outdoors store</a>, if someone tries to save money by buying equipment over the internet, and that equipment ends up not fitting right, it will sit in the garage gathering dust, and its cost per use will soar. If the same person had gone to their local mom and pop store, where a trained salesperson helped them pick out just the right item, one they used as much as possible and got years of enjoyment out of, the cost per use plummets, making the more expensive purchase the true bargain over time.</p>\n<p>Another good example of this is buying a mattress — you’ll be spending a third of your life on it, so purchasing one that helps you get a deep sleep night after night is an incredible value, even if the mattress you choose is more expensive than a cheaper model that would have left you tossing and turning just to save a few bucks up front.</p>\n<p><strong>Generic versus Brand Name</strong></p>\n<p>Of course, when determining price versus value, always look into what you’re getting for the higher price. It <em>can</em> equate to higher quality, but certainly not always. The high price might simply go to support a brand name, a celebrity endorsement, or a big advertising budget. This is why when it comes to buying generic items over brand name ones, you have to experiment to find out what the extra cost of the well-known brand is netting you. Some generic brands are actually made in the same factory as the brand name ones, while some are cheaper because of their inferior quality. Here are a few examples:</p>\n<p>At the grocery store:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Cheaper paper towels and toilet paper — you often end up having to use more sheets to get the job done. Doesn’t always pay to go cheap here.</li>\n<li>Garbage bags — lift a cheap packed-to-the-max bag out of the can and be prepared to watch the bottom fall out. You only want to experience this once.</li>\n<li>Store brand zip lock bags — more than adequate as they seal fine and in all probability will only be used once anyway.</li>\n<li>Sugar is sugar and salt is salt.</li>\n<li>Medicines — the FDA requires that the active ingredient in generic medicines be the same as brand name versions. So a generic headache medicine will work just as well as Tylenol.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>In the hardware store:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Paint brushes — buy the best you can. They will hold more paint, be easier to work with, and last you a long time. You never want to try to draw a fine bead of paint with a junky brush that has the bristles splayed in every direction.</li>\n<li>Paint — when you have to apply a second coat of paint because the first didn’t hide the original color, you’ll rue your decision to save a few bucks per gallon.</li>\n<li>Drill bits — cheap ones snap or quickly become dull, resulting in your schlepping back to Home Depot in order to finish drilling the last 3/8″ hole in your project. Alas, this is harder to realize now that almost all, if not all, drill bits come from China.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>It’s hard to know whether a generic item will be as good as a brand name without trying it out. That works for garbage bags, but of course you don’t want to experiment and get burned when you’re buying a big ticket item. We’ll cover how to carefully make those higher-end purchases below.</p>\n<p><strong>Don’t Be Dazzled by Features</strong></p>\n<p>Marketing expert Martin Lindstrom says that while men believe they don’t let their feelings get in the way of their purchasing decisions, their shopping behavior is best defined as “emorational.” Women do make more emotional purchases than men in general, but men often disguise their emotional impulse to buy by concentrating on the practical features of a product. Men like to learn about something’s specs, and can rationalize that getting a more expensive product with a ton of features makes sense. In reality, it’s often the coolness of the product — the way he imagines owning it will make him feel — that is luring him. Paying a hundred dollars more for something with twelve features when you only need two isn’t a good value.</p>\n<p>Of course when you’re first starting out in life, you often can’t afford the higher upfront costs of quality products, and you shouldn’t go into debt to get them. Try to make your cheaper products last as long as possible; don’t buy a replacement if it’s not broken, and try to fix it to extend its life. The longer you use it, the more time you’ll have to save up for a quality item that will last.</p>\n<p><strong>To sum up: instead of purchasing a lot of crap, get a few good things that will bring you a lifetime of utility and enjoyment.</strong></p>\n<p><img title=\"shopping\" src=\"http://content.artofmanliness.com/uploads//2012/04/playboy.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"450\" height=\"572\"></p>\n<h3><strong>Research, Research, Research</strong></h3>\n<p>Before making any big purchase or contracting a service, do as much research as you can. Your goal is to find out if the product will give you the most bang for your buck and will satisfy your demands for quality and safety. If you’re buying a product, just Google the name of it, as specifically as you can, plus “review.” If you’re buying an appliance, try hopping on Amazon or BestBuy and read the reviews there. For electronics, <a href=\"http://www.cnet.com/\">cnet.com</a> is the place to go. You’ll need to use your discernment and have some patience with reviews offered by the public; up to 30% of the reviews may be fake — created by the company that makes the product or the guy who offers the service. Also keep in mind that people who were unhappy are more likely to leave a review than those who were pleased. I like to read a few reviews in the highest, lowest, and in-between categories and then kind of average them together in my mind to get an overall feel for how the product most likely really is.</p>\n<p>There are also sites and publications that offer reviews for specific products. For example, <a href=\"http://www.edmunds.com/\">Edmunds.com</a> and <em>Car and Driver </em>are great for researching vehicle purchases.</p>\n<p>It might even be worth it in some cases to pay for one month’s access to <a href=\"http://www.consumerreports.org/cro/index.htm\">Consumer Reports</a> online reviews. I’ve done this when buying things like computers and washers/dryers.</p>\n<p>When shopping for a specific brand name item use Google Shopping to find the lowest price, then use Bizrate.com to check on the merchant’s reputation. It is not worth saving a few dollars if you end up hassling with a sleazy vendor.</p>\n<p>If you’re researching a service provider, <a href=\"http://www.angieslist.com/\">Angie’s List</a> is the way to go. Look for someone who gets high marks on quality, reliability, and price. It also doesn’t hurt to ask your friends, family, and co-workers for recommendations too. In many cases, posing a question on Facebook to you local friends and family about reliable providers will net you better results than any search engine could.</p>\n<h3><strong>Get Price Quotes from Several Businesses Before Making a Purchase</strong></h3>\n<p>When it comes to hiring someone to perform a service, it really pays to shop around, as prices can vary widely. Again, a lower price may mean lower quality, while at the same time you don’t want to assume that if something is more expensive, it’s automatically better.</p>\n<p>Getting multiple quotes allows you to make service providers compete against each other. If there’s a guy you want to use for various reasons, but another guy gives you a lower price, you can always go back to the first guy and say, “This is guy’s willing to do it for X, can you match that price?”</p>\n<p>Yes, shopping around does take a bit of extra time, but it’s totally worth it if it means you can save hundreds or even thousands of dollars.</p>\n<h3><strong>Learn How to Negotiate</strong></h3>\n<p>For most young men in America, negotiating is a completely foreign concept. We’re socialized into thinking that you simply pay the price offered and that it’s rude to haggle. But if you want your dollar to go as far as it can, you need to learn how to negotiate. This skill can save you a ton of money over your lifetime. Is staying in your comfort zone really worth thousands of dollars that you basically threw out the window?</p>\n<p>Some of your biggest purchases in your life will require you to negotiate — cars and homes being the most obvious. But even if you’re not in the market yet for these big ticket items, knowing how to negotiate can still serve you well. Everything from your car insurance rate to your gym membership is negotiable.</p>\n<p>Last year, Tyler Tervooren wrote an amazingly comprehensive <a href=\"http://artofmanliness.com/2011/05/11/how-to-haggle-like-your-old-man/\">guide to haggling</a> for us. I highly recommend giving it a read. Also, check out <a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0143118757/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=0143118757&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;tag=stucosuccess-20\"><em>Getting to Yes</em></a> — the book is crammed with tips on how to negotiate like a pro.</p>\n<h3><strong>Ignore Up-Sales</strong></h3>\n<p>When you walk into a store or even shop online, businesses want you to spend more money than you originally planned on. To encourage you to open your wallet, they use a technique called up-selling. Up-selling means suggesting upgrades, add-ons, and additional services to customers right before they pay for their original purchase. It’s amazingly effective when done right. Studies show that sales can increase by as much as 40% simply by implementing up-selling at the point of purchase.</p>\n<p>You encounter up-selling all the time, but may not have known what it was called. It’s especially common practice at restaurants. After she brings out your drinks, the waitress will probably say something like, “Would you gentlemen like to try to some of our amazing fried pickles as an appetizer?” You just got up-sold.</p>\n<p>Whenever you shop on Amazon.com, you probably see a list of items that other customers bought who also bought the book you’re buying. That’s another example of up-selling.</p>\n<p>Those types of up-sells are rather benign and can actually be useful. I can’t count the number of times I discovered a fantastic book thanks to Amazon’s suggestions. But you don’t want to be lured into buying something you don’t need or don’t have the money for.</p>\n<p>The up-sells you really need to watch for occur when you buy large appliances or computers.</p>\n<p>Think back to the last time you bought a computer or some other expensive gizmo. You’ve got the product at the checkout counter and before the clerk rings you up he asks, “Would you like to buy an extended warranty? It’s only $25 and it will protect you even if you throw your laptop into a volcano as some sort of sacrifice.” As a general rule, you should decline most extended warranty offers. You probably won’t need it; the manufacturer’s warranty is usually sufficient. Companies know the chances that you’ll actually use the warranty are slim, which is why they push them so hard. In fact, more than 80% of extended warranties go unused. So if a company can sell you one, it’s often pure profit for them.</p>\n<p>Also, watch out for up-sells in the form of add-ons you really don’t need. For example, whenever you buy an HDTV, you’ll probably be told by the guy at BestBuy that you need to get some special $75 HDTV surge protector as well as diamond encased HDMI cables to ensure the best possible resolution. According to my brother, who once worked at Best Buy, you should always, always say no to this stuff. “They don’t do anything. The profit margins on them are high. That’s why we’re told to recommend them,” he says.</p>\n<p>Bottom line: know exactly what you want before making a purchase, and don’t give in to high pressure up-sells.</p>\n<h3><strong>Read Contracts Before Signing</strong></h3>\n<p><a href=\"http://artofmanliness.com/2012/08/18/renting-your-first-apartment/\">Renting an apartment</a>, joining a gym, getting cell phone service, and purchasing health insurance are just a few of the services and products that require us to sign a contract. These agreements legally obligate you and the other party to fulfill certain terms. Failing to stick to your end of the contract can result in stiff penalties and possibly a lawsuit. That’s why it’s so important to take the time to thoroughly read a contract before you sign your name on the dotted line.</p>\n<p>Unfortunately, many people don’t even bother to read contracts because they are long and sometimes overwhelming. While it’s a pain in the rear, get in the habit of reading all contracts before you sign them. If you have to, take it home and read it when you have more time. While you’re reading, look for the following things:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>How much and when will you pay?</li>\n<li>How long does the contract last?</li>\n<li>What are the penalties and consequences if one side doesn’t stick to the agreement?</li>\n<li>How does the contract end? Is there an auto-renewal? And if so, how can you stop it if you no longer want the service?</li>\n<li>What are the causes of terminating the contract?</li>\n<li>How are contract disputes resolved? Arbitration? Mediation? Courts?</li>\n<li>Are all the blanks filled in? Oftentimes contracts will have blank spaces where prices and dates are filled in. Make sure those spaces are filled in before signing so that someone can’t make any changes without your knowledge.</li>\n<li>Are all the oral and handshake agreements written in the contract?</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Don’t be afraid to ask any questions. Also, if you find any terms that you don’t agree with, ask that they be changed. Before you sign, any of the terms in the contract are negotiable.</p>\n<p>After you sign the contract, make sure you get copies of it for your records, which brings us to…</p>\n<h3><strong>Keep Your Receipts, Agreements, Contracts, Etc.</strong></h3>\n<p>Before you purchase something, you should always find out exactly what the store’s return policy is, and after your purchase, you need to hold onto your receipt. If you ever have a problem with a product or service and want to make a return or complaint, you’ll need it, along with any contracts you may have signed. So get in the habit of putting your receipts and agreements in a folder for safe keeping. Never again will you have to rummage through your car or random drawers looking for the receipt for your defunct TV.</p>\n<p>Better yet, digitize all your receipts and contracts and store them in the cloud. I’m slowly making this a habit. I’m using the Evernote app on my iPhone to quickly snap photos of receipts and tagging them with “receipt.” I scan large documents like contracts directly into Evernote on my laptop. Now I don’t have to worry about misplacing receipts, and I have access to them anytime and anywhere.</p>\n<p><strong><em>Have any other tips on being a savvy consumer?

Small talk is the back and forth you have with strangers and acquaintances and even family members that you rarely see.</p>\n<p>I wanted to cover this topic as part of our “31 Basic Life Skills in 31 Days” series because I have interacted with a lot of young men who couldn’t engage in small talk to save their lives – really nice, earnest guys all, but their interactions with those beyond their circle of friends was painfully awkward. And while this form of communication may be “small,” it’s really a big deal when it comes to your personal and professional success, and your overall happiness. So before we discuss how to make it (and learn three, count ‘em three, handy acronyms to improve your conversational skillz), let’s talk about why it’s so crucial.</p>\n<h3><strong>Why the Ability to Make Small Talk Is So Important</strong></h3>\n<p><img title=\"small talk\" src=\"http://content.artofmanliness.com/uploads//2012/08/small-talk1.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"500\" height=\"333\"></p>\n<p>It’s easy to dismiss small talk as idle chit-chat, or superficial or pointless, and claim to only be interested in “real” conversation. But how do you get to the point of having a deeper conversation with someone in the first place? Someone you just met would be weirded out if you just walked up to them and asked, “Why do you think God allows bad things to happen to good people?” Conversation is a ladder, with small talk serving as the first few rungs. You can’t leap-frog up the ladder. That would be like trying to sprint before warming up, or cook a steak without defrosting it, or merge onto a highway without building up speed on the on-ramp, or…well you get the idea.</p>\n<p>Think about it. How did all of your current most important non-familial relationships begin? Most likely with a bit of small talk one day. Asking about a homework assignment in chemistry class or commiserating about the pain you were in while doing bear crawls down the football field. And now you’re best buds.</p>\n<p>Small talk is the portal through which every person you will ever meet will enter your life. That’s huge when you ponder it. You never know who you’re going to encounter in a class, at a coffee shop, at the gym, at a wedding; they could be your future business partner or boss, your future best friend or wife. You simply never know when someone you meet will send your life in a new direction. But if you can’t initiate these relationships, your circle of contacts and intimates will never expand past the current roster of friends whose Facebook updates and tweets you can’t take your eyes off of in order to meet the gaze of those sitting right next to you.</p>\n<h3><strong>How to Gain the Ability to Make Small Talk with Anyone, Anywhere</strong></h3>\n<p>The first step in becoming an expert small talker is to start seeing yourself as the <em>host</em>, as opposed to the <em>guest</em>, in any situation. The host acts as a leader. He’s active, not passive, and takes the initiative in talking with people, guiding the conversation, filling in awkward pauses, introducing people, and making others feel comfortable and welcome.</p>\n<p>How do you become the consummate host wherever you go? Your hosting duties can be broken down into two categories: Approaching Others and Being Approachable.</p>\n<h3><span style=\"text-decoration:underline\"><strong>How to Approach Others</strong></span></h3>\n<h3><strong>Initiating Conversation with Strangers</strong></h3>\n<p>We often feel self-conscious engaging a stranger in small talk, but<strong> </strong>most people are feeling as shy and insecure as you are. It’s a great comfort and relief when someone takes the initiative to talk to them, saving them from standing alone by the punch bowl while they feel awkward and conspicuous. People love to talk (especially about themselves), and are typically flattered when someone is paying attention to them.</p>\n<p>Look for someone who seems approachable, who’s by himself and isn’t talking to someone else or working on something. Make eye contact, smile at them, and then go up to greet them.</p>\n<p>But what then? Anyone who’s had their small talk disintegrate after an exchange of “What do you do?” may worry that their attempt to initiate conservation will fizzle into awkwardness. But when you know what you’re doing, you can sail right over any potential slumps.</p>\n<p><strong>The ARE method of initiating small talk</strong>.<strong> </strong>Communications expert Dr. Carol Fleming offers a three-part process to kick off a conversation: Anchor, Reveal, Encourage (ARE).</p>\n<p><strong><em>Anchor.</em></strong> This is an observation on your “mutual shared reality” that extends the first little thread of connection between you and another person — the lightest of pleasantries about something you’re both seeing or experiencing.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Dr. Landis is hilarious.</li>\n<li>The set list tonight has been fantastic.</li>\n<li>This weather is perfect.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Don’t get caught up thinking that such comments are too superficial, and search in vain for something truly clever to say. Fleming calls such exchanges “friendly noises,” and you both know they’re not meaningful, but just a gradual and polite way to segue into a “real” conversation.</p>\n<p><strong><em>Reveal.</em></strong> Next, disclose something about yourself that is related to the anchor you just threw out.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>I’ve tried to get into Dr. Landis’ class for three semesters, and this is the first time I was able to land a spot.</li>\n<li>There’s a much bigger crowd here than there was at their show last year.</li>\n<li>I’ve been waiting for a break in the heat to go hike Mt. Whilston for the first time.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>By opening up a little more, we extend to the other person a few more threads of connection and trust, while at the same time providing them fodder to which to respond.</p>\n<p><strong><em>Encourage.</em></strong> Now you hand off the ball to them by asking a question:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Did you have a hard time getting into the class?</li>\n<li>Did you see that show?</li>\n<li>Have you ever done that hike?</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>Keep building the conversation</strong>. By employing the effective ARE method, you’ll successfully have exchanged a few pleasantries, but these tender threads of small talk can easily disintegrate and blow away at this point…when the dreaded awkward pause shows up.</p>\n<p>So you want to weave those light threads into an increasingly sturdy rope. You do this by offering follow-up comments and questions that continue to build the conversation. Let’s take a look at how our three example conversations might progress:</p>\n<p><span style=\"color:#000080\">You: Dr. Landis is hilarious. I’ve tried to get into his class for three semesters and this is the first time I was able to land a spot. Did you have a hard time getting into the class?</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"color:#003300\">Person: Yeah, I actually sat on the stairs for the first few classes, and just hoped some people would drop out. Luckily they did, and he added me.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"color:#ff0000\"><em>Once the person has answered your initial question, you can use a follow-up comment or question – each designed to prompt a response. Giving a comment takes more skill, as you have to craft one that will continue the back and forth. Ideally, you should form both a comment and a back-up question in your mind so that if they respond with only a laugh or an uh-huh, you’re ready to get things moving again.</em></span></p>\n<p><span style=\"color:#ff0000\"><em>A clever/humorous comment is one option for your follow-up:</em></span></p>\n<p><span style=\"color:#000080\">You (said jokingly): I’m thinking you had something to do with their disappearance!</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"color:#003300\">Person (laughs): Oh, for sure! I tell ya, people are dying to get in here.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"color:#000080\">You: Are you taking this class for your major or just because you want to?</span></p>\n<p>—</p>\n<p><span style=\"color:#000080\">You: The set list tonight has been fantastic. There’s a much bigger crowd here than at their show last year. Did you see that one?</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"color:#003300\">Person: No, I didn’t actually didn’t discover this band until a few weeks ago.</span></p>\n<p><em><span style=\"color:#ff0000\">There’s no good comment to give here that would keep the conversation going, so a follow-up question is most appropriate.</span> </em></p>\n<p><span style=\"color:#000080\">You: Oh yeah? How did you find out about them?</span></p>\n<p>—</p>\n<p><span style=\"color:#000080\">You: This weather is perfect. I’ve been waiting for a break in the heat to hike Mt. Wilston. Have you ever done that hike?</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"color:#333300\">Person: No, I haven’t.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"color:#ff0000\"><em>Instead of being clever, another option for your follow-up comment is to share a little more about yourself.</em></span></p>\n<p><span style=\"color:#000080\">You: It’s one of my favorite hikes. It only takes about an hour and a half to get to the top from the trailhead and the view is awesome.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"color:#333300\">Person: Well the most I’ve hiked is up the hill on campus, but that does sound pretty doable.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"color:#000080\">You: I think me and a couple of friends will be doing it tomorrow. If you’re interested in coming along, let me know. I’m in 3B.</span></p>\n<p>—</p>\n<p>Whether you follow-up with a comment or question, be sure to alternate between the two options. Strike a balance: too many questions fired one right after the other will make the conversation feel more like an interrogation, and too many comments won’t give the other person a chance to talk. That’s no good, as your interest in what they have to say is what endears you to them.</p>\n<p>So tip the scale more heavily towards questions. Once they respond to one question, you ask clarifying questions about their answer. Start with questions that can be answered with one or two words, and then build on those to expand into open-ended questions that won’t put them on the spot, but will allow them to reveal more or less about themselves, depending on their comfort level. Use questions that begin with phrases like:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Tell me about…</li>\n<li>What was the best part of…</li>\n<li>How did you feel about…</li>\n<li>What brought you to…</li>\n<li>What’s surprised you most…</li>\n<li>How similar/different is that to…</li>\n<li>Why…</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Here are some effective small talk chains, with the common, but less open-ended questions marked through, and a better alternative following it:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Where are you from? → <span style=\"text-decoration:line-through\">Did you live there all of your life?</span>  What was it like to grow up there? → What brought you here? → Are any of your family members close by? →  <span style=\"text-decoration:line-through\">How many siblings do you have?</span> Tell me more about your family. → Is it tough being away from them? → What do you miss most about your hometown?</li>\n</ul>\n<ul>\n<li>What are you majoring in? → What made you decide to choose that major? → <span style=\"text-decoration:line-through\">How do you like it?</span> What’s been the best class you’ve taken so far? → Tell me more about it. → What was the most interesting part of the class? → Do you think you might write about that for your thesis?</li>\n</ul>\n<ul>\n<li>What do you do? → <span style=\"text-decoration:line-through\">Do you like your job?</span> Describe a typical day at work. → How has the economy affected business? → Why has your company thrived while others have taken a beating? → Would you recommend a young man like myself going into the field? → Do you know anyone who might be looking for an intern?</li>\n</ul>\n<h3><strong>Initiating Conversation with Acquaintances</strong></h3>\n<p><img title=\"smalltalk2\" src=\"http://content.artofmanliness.com/uploads//2012/08/smalltalk2.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"368\" height=\"437\"></p>\n<p>Starting some small talk with an acquaintance – someone you only chat with a bit at church each Sunday, a coworker you see around the office sometimes, an old friend you don’t keep in very good contact with but run into occasionally – requires a different approach than breaking the ice with a stranger. In an encounter with an acquaintance, you’ll likely start with a question, but how you craft that question is important.</p>\n<p><strong>Ask open-ended questions.</strong> Here’s how it usually goes: How was your weekend? How’s your day going? How have you been? Whatadya been up to? Fine. Fine. Good. Not much…cue the crickets! Questions like these are conversation killers — they only prompt a one or two word response, and are basically used by most people as rote hellos in passing, not as questions where an actual answer is expected.</p>\n<p>So you have to follow up:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>How was your weekend? <em>Good.</em> What did you do?</li>\n<li>How’s your day going? <em>Good.</em> What’s been the best part so far?</li>\n<li>How have you been? <em>Good.</em> What’s been going well for you?</li>\n</ul>\n<p>If the acquaintance gives another abbreviated response, you can say something like, “What else? I really want to know.” People are used to going through the motions with folks, and are looking for permission to talk a little about themselves. But if they remain reticent, they may simply not want to talk, and you should always respect that.</p>\n<p>Catching up with an acquaintance has unique pitfalls: you know only an outline of his life, but you don’t know what’s changed in it since the last time you talked. So you want to frame your questions with care and keep them neutral to avoid “stepping in it:”</p>\n<ul>\n<li><span style=\"text-decoration:line-through\">Have you landed a job yet</span>? (turns out he’s still unemployed) → What’s been going on with the job search lately?</li>\n<li><span style=\"text-decoration:line-through\">How’s Jen? </span>(she just dumped him) → Bring me up to date about you and Jen.</li>\n<li><span style=\"text-decoration:line-through\">I heard you took a trip out to Cali last month. That must have been awesome!</span> (he had to go to California because his dad died) à What brought you out to California last month?</li>\n<li><span style=\"text-decoration:line-through\">How long have you two been dating</span>? (they haven’t discussed whether they are actually dating yet) à How did you two meet?</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>What Do I Do If I Have Trouble Coming Up With Questions or Things to Say?</strong></p>\n<p><strong>Observe.</strong> Some of the easiest and best questions simply come from observing people and their surroundings:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>I see you got your Ph.D from the University of Washington. Why did you pick that school?</li>\n<li>Ah, you’re reading <em>The Great Gatsby</em>? That’s my favorite book. How are you liking it?</li>\n<li>I can’t help but notice you’re a fan of the Jets. Who do you think their starting QB is going to be?</li>\n<li>Tell me about this picture. Are you running a marathon? Who’s running with you?</li>\n<li>How do you like your Jeep Wrangler?</li>\n<li>Where did you get your hair cut? I’m looking for a good barber.</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>Listen.</strong> You can start a conversation by building on something someone said that wasn’t directly addressed to you, but you were privy to.</p>\n<p>For example, in smaller classes in college, sometimes the professor will have everyone introduce themselves on the first day of class. If there’s someone in the class you’d like to get know more, you can later start a conversation by saying something like: You mentioned you were from Colorado. What part?</p>\n<p>Or after a business presentation, go up to the speaker and say: I thought you made an interesting point about the benefits the traditional newspaper offers over the online version. What do you think is the future of print?</p>\n<p><strong>Compliment.</strong> A good way to kick off some small talk is to tie a compliment and a question together:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>That’s a really nice fountain pen. Is it hard to learn to write with one?</li>\n<li>I was really impressed with the patience you showed with those kids today. How do you stay so calm when they’re bouncing off the walls?</li>\n</ul>\n<p>When complimenting a woman, stick with a behavior, accomplishment, or article of clothing rather than a body part.</p>\n<p><strong>FORM a question in your mind.</strong> If you’re at a table with a group of people and the small talk hits a snag, remember the acronym FORM:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>F</strong>amily. Tell me about your family. Are your siblings alike or different? What new things is your kid doing these days? How’s your grandpa’s health?</li>\n<li><strong>O</strong>ccupation. What are the best and worst parts of your job? How has the economy affected your industry?</li>\n<li><strong>R</strong>ecreation. Are you still running these days? Have you gone on any camping trips lately? What’s the latest thing you’ve built in your workshop? Seen any good movies lately? Read any good books?</li>\n<li><strong>M</strong>otivation. Where do you hope to be in five years? Do you find your job satisfying? What do you like about your new church?</li>\n</ul>\n<h3><span style=\"text-decoration:underline\"><strong>Make Yourself Approachable</strong></span></h3>\n<p>It’s true what Dale Carnegie said: “You can make more friends in two months by becoming interested in other people than you can in two years trying to get other people interested in you.”</p>\n<p>But it’s also nice when others initiate the conversation. Sometimes you’re just not in “host” mode and raring to initiate conversation, but you’re still open for small talk. If you want strangers to strike up a conversation with you, you need to put out the vibe that you’re open to it and that you’d be an interesting person to talk with. You need to be approachable.</p>\n<p>In figuring out how to be a more approachable, just take a look around the room. What people attract you, and which do you seek to avoid. What does each set do or neglect to do?</p>\n<p><strong>Wear a conversation piece.</strong> People often feel the most comfortable in approaching you to ask about some specific item you’re wearing. An arrestingly handsome tie (not a novelty tie), an interesting tie tack, a lapel pin, a unique (but tasteful) <a title=\"A Man’s Guide to Wearing Jewelry\" href=\"http://artofmanliness.com/2012/03/20/mans-guide-wearing-jewelry/\">ring, watch, or necklace</a>, even a printed t-shirt (I’m not talking Affliction here, you know…let’s say <a href=\"http://www.tankfarmclothing.com/MANLINESS-p4043-c4207.html\">one with “Semper Virilis” on it</a>, for example) worn in a casual setting, can all easily inspire curious questions that spark a conversation.</p>\n<p><strong>Exhibit friendly body language.</strong> Our nonverbal body language accounts for the majority of how others perceive us. Body language that is warm and inviting will draw others to you and make them feel comfortable conversing.</p>\n<p>Arthur Wassmer came up with the last acronym we’ll cover today — SOFTEN — to describe the elements of nonverbal behavior that attract others:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>S</strong>mile. A warm, friendly smile puts others at ease. When you’re walking around, display a slight, soft smile. After you make eye contact with someone, give them a bigger, genuine smile.</li>\n<li><strong>O</strong>pen posture. Instead of standing at an angle, with your arms crossed or in your pockets, face others directly and hang your arms naturally by your sides.</li>\n<li><strong>F</strong>orward lean. When listening or speaking, leaning in shows someone you are paying attention. The more intimacy you build with someone, the closer you can lean, but at first, respect the person’s physical space.</li>\n<li><strong>T</strong>ouch by shaking hands. <a title=\"A Manly Handshake: An Illustrated Guide\" href=\"http://artofmanliness.com/2011/08/22/manly-handshake/\">A good hearty handshake</a>, where the web between your thumb and pointer finger meets theirs, conveys confidence and vitality.</li>\n<li><strong>E</strong>ye contact. Being able to make eye contact shows you’re confident and builds intimacy with others. We’ve written some seriously great articles on <a title=\"Look ‘Em in the Eye: Part I -The Importance of Eye Contact\" href=\"http://artofmanliness.com/2012/02/05/look-em-in-the-eye-part-i-the-importance-of-eye-contact/\">the importance of eye contact</a> and <a title=\"Look ‘Em in the Eye: Part II – How to Make Eye Contact the Right Way in Life, Business, and Love\" href=\"http://artofmanliness.com/2012/02/12/look-em-in-the-eye-part-ii-how-to-make-eye-contact-the-right-way-in-life-business-and-love/\">how to do it right</a>, that I highly recommend reading.</li>\n<li><strong>N</strong>od.  <a title=\"Listen Up! Part II: 15 Techniques to Improve Our Listening\" href=\"http://artofmanliness.com/2012/05/08/listen-up-part-ii-15-techniques-to-improve-our-listening/\">Whenever you listen to someone speak</a>, nodding, along with other verbal and nonverbal forms of feedback like “uh-huhs”  and “hmmms,” show you’re focused on what the speaker has to say.</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>Be well-groomed and well-dressed.</strong> Not over dressed – that will drive folks away and make you seem uptight. But don some clean clothes that fit well and exhibit your own style and lots of confidence.</p>\n<p>And a note about facial hair…it’s a dynamo conversation starter. Everyone wants to comment on my mustache. And beards, while they used to be the mark of the crusty backwoodsman or shifty rebel, are now often read by folks as “approachable” – the look of a super laid-back, good-humored guy.</p>\n<p><strong>Offer your name to those you’ve met before.</strong> A new acquaintance may not remember it. A former professor may have had thousands of students come through their classes. Trying to figure out your name as you talk, along with the worry that the fact they don’t know it will be revealed, will distract them from focusing on the conversation. So just offer it up when you see them:  Hi, Dr. Smith, Brett McKay from last year’s History 101!</p>\n<p><strong>Never give one word answers.</strong> A “yes,” or “no” FULL STOP sounds curt. Ever been to this event before? <em>No</em>. Are you a friend of the groom? <em>Yes</em>. Just add a bit to soften it, as it makes you sound more game to talk: No I haven’t. Yes I am.</p>\n<p><strong>Expand your answers, even when a “No I haven’t” or “Yes I am” will technically suffice.</strong> Examples: No I haven’t, but my friend Michael Davidson finally convinced me to come this year. Do you know him? I think you guys went to the same high school. Or: Yes I am. Chuck and I were fraternity brothers at the University of Alabama.”</p>\n<p>The goal here is to provide your small talk partner with more information from which they can make a comment or pose a question that will keep the conversation going. Just think of when the shoe’s on the other foot – the more fodder someone gives you, the easier it is to formulate a good response.</p>\n<p><strong>Mirror your partner.</strong> People feel more comfortable, and are charmed more, by those who match their behavior, tone of voice, talking speed, and so on. Don’t match your conversation partner tic for tic, but if they speak softly, bring your own voice down a notch; if they’re enthusiastic, act similarly.</p>\n<p><strong>Give an accessible description of your job.</strong> One of the most common questions for folks to ask is, “What do you do?” If your job is pretty technical, try to put it in layman’s terms, so that they have something to ask you follow-up questions about, as opposed to just saying, “Oh, nuclear fission, huh?”</p>\n<p><strong>Have a wide range of knowledge and keep up with current events.</strong> By being well-read and keeping up with what’s going on in the world, you’ll always have a bit of knowledge to match the varied interests of those you meet.</p>\n<h3><strong>Practice!</strong></h3>\n<p>Technology has created an interesting phenomenon in which people increasingly crave real face-to-face connection, while at the same time becoming less equipped to facilitate it.</p>\n<p>The only way to get better at small talk is to practice. And you have to practice it in situations where it really doesn’t matter, so that you’re ready when it does.</p>\n<p>Strike up some small talk with the man behind the deli counter or the person working the register at the grocery store: How’s your day going? How much longer on your shift? What’s been the best part of your day so far?</p>\n<p>Instead of ducking out of events that you’re not too keen on attending, go with the express purpose of practicing your small talk skills. Look it as your conversation lab – you don’t care much about what the people there think of you anyway, so feel free to try things out and make mistakes.</p>\n<p>Don’t get hung up on “failing.” If someone’s not interested in talking, that’s okay. No harm, no foul. Just move on. Small talk is only annoying when it’s unwelcome, and the initiator fails to pick up on this disinterest. If the person you’re trying to engage gives several short answers, and keeps angling their body away from you, let them get on with whatever they’d rather be doing.</p>\n<p>But as the old saying goes, you have to <a title=\"How to Wrestle an Alligator\" href=\"http://artofmanliness.com/2010/10/19/how-to-wrestle-an-alligator/\">wrestle some gators</a> to make a gator soup. All experiences, good and bad, will help you hone your mastery of small talk, so you can talk to that girl on the shuttle to campus with ease, and you don’t have to wait in your car to avoid walking up the stairs to your apartment at the same time as someone else.</p>\n<p>_______________</p>\n<p><em>Sources: </em></p>\n<p><em><a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/Its-Way-You-Say-Well-spoken/dp/1450215165/ref=sr_1_9?s=books&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1345744334&amp;sr=1-9&amp;keywords=small+talk\">It’s the Way You Say It</a> by Carol Fleming</em></p>\n<p><em><a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/Fine-Art-Small-Talk-Conversation/dp/1401302262/ref=sr_1_1?s=books&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1345744283&amp;sr=1-1&amp;keywords=small+talk\">The Fine Art of Small Talk</a> by Debra Fine</em></p>\n<p><em><a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/111820347X/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=111820347X&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;tag=stucosuccess-20\">Talk to Strangers</a> by David Topus </em></p>\n<p><em>Ye Olde Book of Life Experience</em></p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Related posts:<ol>\n<li><a href=\"http://artofmanliness.com/2009/06/16/30-days-to-a-better-man-day-17-talk-to-3-strangers/\" rel=\"bookmark\" title=\"30 Days to a Better Man Day 17: Talk to 3 Strangers\">30 Days to a Better Man Day 17: Talk to 3 Strangers</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"http://artofmanliness.com/2012/08/07/how-to-make-a-bed-using-hospital-corners/\" rel=\"bookmark\" title=\"Heading Out on Your Own — Day 7: How to Make a Bed\">Heading Out on Your Own — Day 7: How to Make a Bed</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"http://artofmanliness.com/2010/08/25/get-the-perfect-haircut-how-to-talk-to-your-barber/\" rel=\"bookmark\" title=\"Get the Perfect Haircut: How to Talk to Your Barber\">Get the Perfect Haircut: How to Talk to Your Barber</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"http://artofmanliness.com/2012/08/07/the-company-mans-guide-to-starting-a-side-hustle-part-ii-think-big-act-small/\" rel=\"bookmark\" title=\"The Company Man’s Guide to Starting a Side Hustle — Part II: Think Big, Act Small\">The Company Man’s Guide to Starting a Side Hustle — Part II: Think Big, Act Small</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"http://artofmanliness.com/2008/02/11/talk-like-frank-sinatra/\" rel=\"bookmark\" title=\"Talk Like Frank Sinatra\">Talk Like Frank Sinatra</a></li>\n</ol></p><p><iframe src=\"http://feedads.g.doubleclick.net/~ah/f/f3iv4dtffn7nla1icg3h2et32g/300/250?ca=1&amp;fh=280#http%3A%2F%2Fartofmanliness.com%2F2012%2F08%2F22%2Fhow-to-make-small-talk%2F\" width=\"100%\" height=\"280\" frameborder=\"0\" scrolling=\"no\" marginwidth=\"0\" marginheight=\"0\"></iframe></p><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/TheArtOfManliness/~4/5XQWkyQ1Sqo\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\">"

True, for much of human history men did the hunting/farming and women did the cooking, and this arrangement continued to work well into the 20<sup>th</sup> century. Young men made a quick transition from living with their flapjack-flipping mother, to settling down with a meatloaf-making wife. Or, he lodged at boarding houses that provided victuals along with a bed.</p>\n<p>But those days are long gone; accommodations that come with a cook are now virtually non-existent (although it lives on in fraternity houses), and men are remaining bachelors longer – well into their late 20s and early 30s. As all modern men still need to eat virtually every single day, the only choice that remains is either starving…or being completely <em>dependent</em> on restaurant meals and take-out food.</p>\n<p>Maturing into a grown man means becoming self-sufficient, so daily dependence isn’t an option. Further, not only does learning to cook help you become more independent, it offers other benefits as well:</p>\n<p><strong>Keeps you healthy and strong.</strong> When you cook for yourself, you know and control exactly what you put in your mouth. Almost anything you make for yourself, even the same dish served at a restaurant, will have less salt, fat, calories, and additives than the commercially-made variety.</p>\n<p><strong>Saves you money.</strong> Sure, it is possible to eat cheaply by ordering all your food off the dollar menu, but while fast food won’t clip your wallet, it will take a toll on your health, which will cost you big bucks down the line. When it comes to making real, wholesome food, cooking at home is generally cheaper than eating out.</p>\n<p><strong>Impresses the ladies.</strong> As a young man, you’re going to be dating, and <a href=\"http://artofmanliness.com/2011/03/18/the-10-commandments-of-the-at-home-dinner-date/\">nothing impresses a gal like a man who can invite her back to his place for a home-cooked meal.</a></p>\n<p><strong>Gives you enjoyment.</strong> No, I don’t <em>always</em> enjoy cooking. But when you have time and are in the right mood, it can be very satisfying to create something tasty for you and for your friends/family.</p>\n<p>Now, I’m not a home cooking zealot. Sometimes the way I feel about cooking can be summed up in <a href=\"http://theoatmeal.com/comics/cook_home\">this comic from The Oatmeal</a>; it can seem like it is more hassle than it’s worth, and when you’re super busy and stressed, the convenience of take-out is a lifesaver. The key is striking a balance, and you can’t do that if you can’t cook anything beyond toast and ramen.</p>\n<p>The good news here is that while gourmet chef-ery takes a lot of training and practice, simple cooking can be learned by anyone who knows how to read. So in this post, we cover many of the basics a young man who’s never cooked for himself needs to know to get started. First we’ll talk about how to stock your kitchen with equipment and your pantry with staple items. Then we’ll talk about a few basic skills and bits of know-how you need to learn in order to cook edible, hopefully delicious, food. Finally, because you don’t need to amass the kitchen equipment listed below all at once, we’ll talk about some things you can cook when your options and tools are limited.</p>\n<p>Let’s get started.</p>\n<p><img title=\"man_cooking\" src=\"http://content.artofmanliness.com/uploads//2012/08/man_cooking.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"365\" height=\"429\"></p>\n<h3><strong>Stocking Your Kitchen: Essential Equipment </strong></h3>\n<p>For this section, I had AoM’s food writer, Matt Moore, give us the lowdown on how to outfit your kitchen. Here’s what he had to say:</p>\n<blockquote><p>For me, it’s always about quality over quantity. Instead of investing in specialty garlic presses, zesters, or other gimmicks – just give me a killer knife that’ll do all those jobs and not get lost in my junk drawer. Less is always more.</p>\n<p>For that reason I’ve put together my list of essential kitchen equipment needed for every guy. You don’t need to go out immediately and stock your kitchen with everything listed here. You can acquire this stuff over time. Be resourceful and check yard sales, flea markets, or online outlets that offer these items at great deals. Meanwhile, improvise and make the most of what you have.</p></blockquote>\n<p><strong>Hardware: Pots/Pans/Baking Dishes</strong></p>\n<p><img title=\"Hardware\" src=\"http://content.artofmanliness.com/uploads//2012/08/Hardware1.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"500\" height=\"732\"></p>\n<ol>\n<li><strong>(1) Small 2.5-qt Pot with Lid </strong>- <em>terrific for making sauces, steaming veggies, or heating liquids.</em></li>\n<li><strong>1 Large 6-qt Pot with Lid </strong>- <em>perfect for boiling pasta or potatoes.</em></li>\n<li><strong>9×13 Pyrex Baking Dish </strong>- <em>a must have for baking or roasting.</em></li>\n<li><strong>12-Inch Cast Iron Skillet </strong>- <em>cast iron cookware is inexpensive and will last a lifetime.

But <em>how</em> do you read a recipe? These tips will up your chances of culinary success.</p>\n<p><strong>1. First things first, read through the recipe in its entirety.</strong> It’s easy to look only at a recipe’s ingredients before deciding to make something. But when it comes time to prepare the dish, you may find you don’t have a tool or ingredient that may only be mentioned in the directions, or that it’s a lot more complicated than you thought, and a little above your pay grade. If the recipe includes terms you don’t recognize, look them up.</p>\n<p><strong>2. Add up how much time it will take.</strong> Be sure to check out the “prep time” (slicing, stirring, can-opening) and “cook time” (baking, frying, grilling). Add them up to find the total time needed to complete the dish. If it’s your first time making a certain recipe, it will definitely take you longer than the given time; give yourself an ample cushion.</p>\n<p><strong>3. Make sure you have all the ingredients.</strong> If you think you might have something already, but aren’t sure, check to see. Also make sure it’s still fresh. Then write a list of all the ingredients you don’t have on hand.</p>\n<p><strong>4. Take note of what you need to do <em>before</em> the preparations begin</strong>. Before you start slicing, dicing, and mixing, you may need to do things like preheat the oven, soften butter, or defrost meat.</p>\n<p><strong>5. Set out all of your ingredients and tools.</strong> Line up everything you will need: bowls, pans, and utensils are on the counter, ingredients are measured and ready to go. This will not only make things smoother as you go along, saving you from dashing to and from the fridge and the cupboards, but it’s basically a chance to check off the recipe’s ingredient and supply list one more time; you don’t want to get halfway through your preparations, only to realize you’re ¼ cup short of the required 1 cup of flour.</p>\n<h3><strong>Measuring Ingredients</strong></h3>\n<p><strong>Dry Measurements Versus Wet Measurements</strong></p>\n<p>When a recipe calls for a ½ cup of this, and 2 cups of that, the tool you reach for depends on whether the ingredient is dry or wet (if it’s pourable – oil, sauce, milk — it’s wet).</p>\n<p>There are two options: wet measuring cups and dry measuring cups. While they technically each hold the same volume, there are reasons why you should choose one or the other for respective ingredients.</p>\n<p><img title=\"Measurements\" src=\"http://content.artofmanliness.com/uploads//2012/08/Measurements1.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"500\" height=\"267\"></p>\n<p>A liquid measuring cup has small measurement gradients printed up the side, and the top fill line sits well below the spout, so you don’t spill any liquid when you pick up the cup. When you fill a wet measuring cup, don’t hold it in your hand – put it on a level surface and squat down to make sure the liquid is sitting right at the desired mark.</p>\n<p>Dry measuring cups are meant to be filled up to the very top, and then leveled off with a knife. If you filled a dry measuring cup to the very brim with a liquid, you’d be bound to spill some. And if you used a wet measuring cup for a dry ingredient, you wouldn’t be able to level it off.</p>\n<p>Here’s how you fill a dry measuring cup with a few common ingredients:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><em>Flour</em> — lightly spoon into cup and level off with knife. Don’t tap the cup to settle, or pack in with spoon or fingers.</li>\n<li><em>White sugar</em> — scoop directly from bag/container. Level off with knife.</li>\n<li><em>Brown sugar</em> – scoop and then press with back of a spoon until the sugar is level with the brim of the cup.</li>\n<li><em>Peanut butter/shortening</em> – pack with spatula (spraying the cup with cooking spray before using PB will result in it sliding out easier).</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>Tablespoons Versus Teaspoons</strong></p>\n<p>A common mistake beginner cooks make is to confuse the tablespoon with the teaspoon, as they are often abbreviated in recipes in different ways, and these abbreviations are very similar. You may see any of the following:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><em>Tablespoon:</em> T, tb, tbs, tbsp, tblsp, tblspn. (May be capitalized or lower case)<em></em></li>\n<li><em>Teaspoon</em>: t, ts, tsp, tspn. (Almost always lower case)</li>\n</ul>\n<p>A tablespoon is larger than a teaspoon. In the US, one tablespoon equals three teaspoons.</p>\n<p>You can use tablespoons and teaspoons for both wet and dry ingredients. A recipe may call for a level or rounded amount; rounded roughly sits above the rim of the spoon, level is done by scraping off the top with a knife.</p>\n<p><strong>Butter</strong></p>\n<p>A stick of butter will have the measurements printed on the wrapper of each stick. Just mark off what you need and cut through the butter, wrapper and all.</p>\n<h3><strong>Basic Cooking Skills Every Young Man Should Master</strong></h3>\n<p>There are tons of cooking techniques out there, and down the road you may want to learn to make a soufflé or smoke some ribs. But it really only takes a few basic how-tos to keep yourself well-fed and happy.</p>\n<p>First we’ll cover one of the most basic of the basics – how to make pasta—and then I invite you to click on the images below to learn more simple, but handy, skills.</p>\n<p><strong>How to Make Pasta</strong></p>\n<p><img title=\"pasta\" src=\"http://content.artofmanliness.com/uploads//2012/08/pasta.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"400\" height=\"260\"></p>\n<p>Pasta is an especially good option for young men; it’s cheap, versatile, and relatively good for you (depending on what you add to it). It’s also really simple to make. At least, it should be. But I didn’t realize I was making it wrong until after I got married; Kate was aghast to see me put the pasta in right after filling up the pot with water, instead of waiting for the water to boil. A recipe for mushy pasta. Here’s how to do it right:</p>\n<p><strong>1. Use about 5 quarts of water for a pound of pasta.</strong> That sounds like a lot, but a common mistake is to use too little water, which leads to the pasta sticking and clumping together. When planning your mealtime, keep in mind that that much water takes a while to boil, especially because you want to start with cold water (as it absorbs the least amount of impurities from your pipes).</p>\n<p><strong>2. Choose a pot that will leave you some room on top, so the water doesn’t boil over. </strong>5 quarts of water in an 8-quart pot works well. If all you’ve got is a 6-quart-er, just keep a close eye on it.</p>\n<p><strong>3. Bring water to a rolling boil. </strong>This<strong> </strong>means it’s boiling across the whole surface of the water and you can’t stop the boil by stirring it. Putting a cover on the pot will help it reach this point faster.</p>\n<p><strong>4. Once boiling, add two tablespoons of salt.</strong> The salt boosts the boiling temperature slightly and adds a little flavor to the pasta. But fear not — it only raises the pasta’s sodium content a tiny bit.</p>\n<p><strong>5. Add the pasta, and stir it around immediately to keep it from sticking together, as the strands release their starch as they hit the heat</strong>. Stir the pot again every few minutes until pasta is done.</p>\n<p><strong>6. Consult the pasta package for relatively accurate cooking time</strong>. A minute before the minimum given cooking time on the package is up, fish out a strand with tongs and bite into it. The consistency you’re looking for is “al dente” (Italian for “to the tooth”) – tender, but with a little bite. Keep in mind that the pasta will continue to cook a bit even after you remove it from the heat.</p>\n<p><strong>7. As soon as the pasta reaches desired doneness, dump it into a colander.</strong> Pick up the colander and give it a few shakes to get the water out. But don’t overstrain it – a little wetness works well with sauce. Don’t rinse the pasta either (unless you’re making a cold pasta salad), as it rinses away the starch that coats each strand, and this starch will help the sauce stick to the pasta.</p>\n<p><strong>8. Toss pasta with sauce immediately, if you can.</strong> If you can’t, toss the pasta with a little olive oil to keep the strands from sticking to each other.</p>\n<p><em>Click the images below to read past AoM articles on basic cooking skills:</em></p>\n<p style=\"text-align:center\"><a href=\"http://artofmanliness.com/2011/04/20/basic-knife-skills/\"><img title=\"Basic-Knife-Skills\" src=\"http://content.artofmanliness.com/uploads//2012/08/Basic-Knife-Skills.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"400\" height=\"350\"></a></p>\n<p style=\"text-align:center\"><a href=\"http://artofmanliness.com/2011/10/25/breakfast-basics-how-to-make-better-eggs/\"><img title=\"eggs\" src=\"http://content.artofmanliness.com/uploads//2012/08/eggs.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"498\" height=\"411\"></a></p>\n<p style=\"text-align:center\"><a href=\"http://artofmanliness.com/2012/01/31/lets-get-cracking-how-to-make-an-omelet/\"><img title=\"omelet\" src=\"http://content.artofmanliness.com/uploads//2012/08/omelet.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"499\" height=\"400\"></a></p>\n<p style=\"text-align:center\"><a href=\"http://artofmanliness.com/2010/09/20/mastering-man-food-how-to-cook-bacon-properly/\"><img title=\"bacon\" src=\"http://content.artofmanliness.com/uploads//2012/08/bacon.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"400\" height=\"466\"></a></p>\n<p style=\"text-align:center\"><a href=\"http://artofmanliness.com/2011/06/22/grilling-basics-building-a-better-burger/\"><img title=\"burger\" src=\"http://content.artofmanliness.com/uploads//2012/08/burger.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"500\" height=\"442\"></a></p>\n<p style=\"text-align:center\"><a href=\"http://artofmanliness.com/2008/03/12/grilling-the-perfect-steak/\"><img title=\"steak\" src=\"http://content.artofmanliness.com/uploads//2012/08/steak.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"331\" height=\"479\"></a></p>\n<p style=\"text-align:center\"><a href=\"http://artofmanliness.com/2011/02/25/kitchen-fundamentals-how-to-make-a-whole-roasted-chicken/\"><img title=\"whole-roasted-chicken\" src=\"http://content.artofmanliness.com/uploads//2012/08/whole-roasted-chicken.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"499\" height=\"449\"></a></p>\n<h3><strong>What Can I Make With….?</strong></h3>\n<p>Even if heading out on your own means setting up camp in a college dorm with a meal plan in hand, that doesn’t mean cooking can’t have any place in your life for the next two semesters. There will be times when you don’t feel like making your way over to the cafeteria or food court, and times when they won’t be open, leaving you to pillage the dorm vending machine. And unless you have an unlimited meal plan, making some meals for yourself can save you money.</p>\n<p>Of course whether you’re headed to a dorm room or perhaps a tiny studio apartment that only offers a kitchenette, or you do have access to a kitchen but not the assortment of appliances and pots mentioned above, you may feel like it isn’t possible for you to make anything with such limited room and equipment. But with a little creativity, you can truly whip up some tasty stuff for yourself with only the most Spartan of supplies.</p>\n<p>Below we offer a few suggestions for things you can make if you only have one or more of the following appliances.</p>\n<p><strong>What Can I Make with a Fridge and a Hot Pot?</strong></p>\n<p>This is the situation many college freshmen will find themselves in; dorm rules often allow students two appliances in their rooms: a small refrigerator and a hot pot (an electric kettle that quickly boils water). Obviously the number of things you can make with these appliances, beyond ramen and mac n’ cheese of course, is limited, but there are still options:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><em>Salad.</em> Get some salad makings; raw veggies, pre-cooked chicken, and dressing – toss together.</li>\n<li><em>Cold sandwiches.</em> You don’t have to limit yourself to bologna and cheese, either. There are hundreds of really good sandwich combos out there. Don’t forget wrap sandwiches too – get a Caesar salad kit, mix, add some precooked chicken, mix, and wrap.</li>\n<li><em>Oatmeal.</em> Get the kind that’s not quite old fashioned whole oats, but are a step up from instant. Add nuts and dried fruit.</li>\n<li><em>Hard boiled eggs.</em> Portable and nutritious snack.</li>\n<li><em>Canned soups.</em> Easy, nutritious, and can hit the spot on a winter’s day.</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>What Can I Make with a Microwave?</strong></p>\n<p>Some dorms allow microwaves in students’ rooms, or have a common microwave for all to use. It is a surprisingly versatile tool — good for more than heating up your Hungry Man dinners.</p>\n<ul>\n<li><em>Scrambled eggs.</em> This was a staple of mine freshman year, and not as bad as you might think. Scramble the eggs in a bowl, and nuke for 60-90 seconds, stopping to stir once or twice. Add salt, pepper, and ketchup to taste. You can also <a href=\"http://whatscookingamerica.net/Eggs/MicrowaveEggs.htm\">poach and “fry</a>,” eggs this way. But never cook them in their shell, as they can explode, and always prick the yolk if you leave it intact.</li>\n<li><em>Bacon.</em> What are eggs without bacon? Layer a plate with three paper towels, place bacon strips on top, and cover with another paper towel. Cook at about one minute per slice.</li>\n<li><em>Bean and cheese burrito.</em> Warm up some refried or black beans and layer in a tortilla with cheese, guacamole, salsa, sour cream…whatever your heart desires.</li>\n<li><em>Rice+Tasty Bite/Soup.</em> You can make instant rice in the microwave, or they even sell pre-cooked rice in a package that only needs to be warmed up. Add some beef stew or <a href=\"http://shop.tastybite.com/Entres/c/TastyBite@Entrees?gclid=CM7spvHV-bECFWXhQgodeHEABw\">Tasty Bite Indian food</a> on top of the rice. The latter is a good option for vegetarians.</li>\n<li><em>Pizza bagels.</em> Better in a toaster oven, for sure, but fine in a pinch.</li>\n<li><em>Corn on the cob.</em> <a href=\"http://www.cooks.com/rec/search/0,1-0,microwave_corn_on_cob,FF.html\">Yes, you can actually make it in the microwave.</a></li>\n<li><em>Steamer meals.</em> <a href=\"http://www.primermagazine.com/2012/earn/the-perfect-easy-and-healthy-office-lunch\">Primer Magazine did a great, well, primer, on how to use microwave steam bags to cook up tasty and super nutritious meals</a>. You add meat, veggies, and sauce to the special bags, and steam in the microwave. Sample recipe: Beef fajitas strips, pineapple, onion, bell peppers (red, green, yellow), BBQ sauce.</li>\n</ul>\n<div style=\"width:508px\"><img title=\"bag\" src=\"http://content.artofmanliness.com/uploads//2012/08/bag.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"498\" height=\"249\"><p>Image from Primer Magazine</p></div>\n<p><strong>What Can I Make with a George Foreman Grill?</strong></p>\n<p>Obviously George’s Lean Mean Grilling Machine is adept at cooking things like burgers and chicken breasts, but it handles meats like bacon and sausage patties well, along with making good grilled cheese sandwiches, paninis of any variety, and tasty quesadillas too. I wouldn’t go out of my way to get one though – it’s one of those things that sounds handy, but will end up gathering dust on a shelf. At least it did for me.</p>\n<p><strong></strong><strong>What Can I Make with</strong> <strong>a Rice Cooker?</strong></p>\n<p>A rice cooker is basically a steamer and a hot plate, and if you have a microwave and a hot plate (or regular stovetop), you don’t need one, unless you enjoy using it and have the space. But you might live in a dorm that allows rice cookers, but not hot plates, and if that’s the case, take heart; despite the name, this appliance can cook a lot more than the white stuff – <a href=\"http://www.sallyskitchen.com/html/scrambled_eggs.html\">eggs</a>, <a href=\"http://www.sallyskitchen.com/html/rice_cooker_spaghetti.html\">spaghetti</a>,  <a href=\"http://www.sallyskitchen.com/html/chicken_soup.html\">chicken soup</a>, and even <a href=\"http://www.sallyskitchen.com/html/quick_taco_meat.html\">taco meat</a> and <a href=\"http://www.sallyskitchen.com/html/country_spare_ribs.html\">spare ribs</a> can be whipped up in one.</p>\n<p><strong></strong><strong>What Can I Make with a Crockpot?</strong></p>\n<p>The ladies have been all over crockpotting lately, and it’s perplexing more men don’t adopt this cooking tool, as it’s one of the easiest, least time-intensive methods of cooking available. One of my favorite crockpot meals is stupidly simple: plop in a couple of chicken breasts, pour some BBQ sauce over them, and then let it cook on low for six hours (or on high for four). When it’s done, you shred the chicken, and pile it on some Texas toast. Delicious. I also enjoy making easy beef stew: throw in some stew meat, cut-up potatoes, carrots, and green beans, and then some V8 juice and other spices to taste. Press cook. Go about your day. Enjoy your stew hours later.</p>\n<p>Hundreds of other tasty crockpot recipes are only a Google search away.</p>\n<p><strong></strong><strong>What Can I Make with</strong> <strong>a Hot Plate/Stovetop and One Pot?</strong></p>\n<p>If you have a hot plate or stovetop, but your cookware is limited, do a search for “one pot meals.” These are just what the name implies, and they make clean-up a snap. Easy chili is one of my go-tos: brown hamburger meat at the bottom of the pan, add a can of drained pinto beans, diced tomatoes, and a packet of chili seasoning. Simmer for 10-15 minutes. Done. I like to ladle mine over some Fritos and top with cheese. It’s not going to win any prizes in a chili-cooking competition, but it’s really satisfying on a cold winter’s day.</p>\n<p>Also, check out Matt’s post on <a href=\"http://artofmanliness.com/2010/08/17/meals-for-the-bachelor-5-simple-one-skillet-recipes/\">one skillet meals that are proportioned for the bachelor</a>; the stir-fry has become a staple around here.</p>\n<h3><strong>But, Brett! I don’t even have any of the things above! Is there anything I can make for myself?</strong></h3>\n<p>Maybe you’re living in a dorm that’s super strict about appliances in rooms. Well, there is one trick you can use…get out your iron. Yes, the one you use to get the wrinkles out of your shirts.</p>\n<p><strong>Iron-Made Grill Cheese</strong></p>\n<p>First, I’ll show you how to make a classic comfort food staple, the grilled cheese, using an iron in your dorm room.</p>\n<div style=\"width:510px\"><img title=\"IMG_1158-1\" src=\"http://content.artofmanliness.com/uploads//2012/08/IMG_1158-1.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"500\" height=\"333\"><p>What you need: an iron, a towel, aluminum foil, butter, two slices of bread and two slices of cheese. Heat up the iron to its highest setting (no steam!) as you get things together. You’ll want to iron on a towel or some other protective surface.</p></div>\n<div style=\"width:510px\"><img title=\"IMG_1182\" src=\"http://content.artofmanliness.com/uploads//2012/08/IMG_1182.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"500\" height=\"333\"><p>Butter the bread.

Cook time will depend on how hot your iron gets, so the first time you try this, check on it 45 seconds in to see how it’s fairing and to make sure it doesn’t burn. Once one side is done, flip the foil packet over and repeat on the other side.</p></div>\n<div style=\"width:510px\"><img title=\"IMG_1191-1\" src=\"http://content.artofmanliness.com/uploads//2012/08/IMG_1191-1.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"500\" height=\"333\"><p>Boom!

You can also add turkey or ham to make the sandwich heartier.</p></div>\n<p><strong>Iron-Made Bacon</strong></p>\n<p>Not only can you add turkey or ham to your grilled cheese, you can also add some…bacon! Here’s how:</p>\n<div style=\"width:510px\"><img title=\"IMG_1196-1\" src=\"http://content.artofmanliness.com/uploads//2012/08/IMG_1196-1.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"500\" height=\"333\"><p>What you need: bacon, foil, towel, and iron.</p></div>\n<div style=\"width:510px\"><img title=\"IMG_1199-1\" src=\"http://content.artofmanliness.com/uploads//2012/08/IMG_1199-1.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"500\" height=\"333\"><p>Tear a strip of bacon in half (you can make more or less depending on the size/width of your iron), and place on foil.</p></div>\n<div style=\"width:510px\"><img title=\"IMG_1202\" src=\"http://content.artofmanliness.com/uploads//2012/08/IMG_1202.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"500\" height=\"750\"><p>Wrap in foil and crimp the sides — you don’t want any bacon grease to escape.</p></div>\n<div style=\"width:510px\"><img title=\"IMG_1203-1\" src=\"http://content.artofmanliness.com/uploads//2012/08/IMG_1203-1.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"500\" height=\"333\"><p>Set iron packet on a towel and place iron on top. Let it sit there for about 5 minutes, check to see how it is doing, and then flip and repeat.

When you’re on your own, car maintenance becomes your responsibility. Yes, it can be expensive and time consuming, but the investment you make today will save you money down the road.</p>\n<p>Don’t be like the<a href=\"http://www.roadandtravel.com/safetyandsecurity/teensandtots/collegestudentscars.htm\"> 1/3 of college students who change their oil less than two times a year</a> because they simply forget to do it.  Your car won’t magically take care of itself. Get in the habit of regular car maintenance and quit relying on your folks to remind you to get your tires rotated or your oil changed.</p>\n<p>Below we take you through some of the rudimentary things you should be doing to ensure your car stays in tip top shape.</p>\n<h3><strong>Every Other Fill-up, Do These Three Things</strong></h3>\n<p>Instead of standing at the gas pump and reading the advertisements for a credit card while you wait for your tank to fill, use that time to give your car a quick check-up (and cleaning) by performing three simple tasks:</p>\n<p><strong>1. Clean windshield.</strong> A dirty, bug-splattered windshield is a safety hazard, as it obscures your view of the road. So give it a regular cleaning. Using the spongy part of the gas station squeegee, soak the whole windshield with the cleaning fluid. Then pull the squeegee tightly from the middle of the windshield to the sides, finishing off the remaining streaks by pulling it top to bottom. This is especially important after an extended drive on the highway when your windshield is littered with insect carcasses and using your car’s washing fluid and wipers to remove them only creates a big, smeary mess that obscures your line of sight even more.</p>\n<p>If your headlights are dirty, give them a squeegeeing as well.</p>\n<p>Your wipers have a role to play in keeping the windshield clean too, but we’ll talk about them later this week.</p>\n<p><strong>2. Check tire pressure. </strong>Maintaining proper tire pressure will keep you safe and even save you a little dough. Improperly inflated tires — and this may mean over-inflated or under-inflated — don’t handle or stop as well as tires with the correct pressure. They also increase your chance of a blow out. Plus, tires with the correct pressure have a longer life and increase your fuel efficiency.</p>\n<div style=\"width:510px\"><img title=\"tirepressure\" src=\"http://content.artofmanliness.com/uploads//2012/08/tirepressure.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"500\" height=\"333\"><p>You’ll often find your vehicle’s recommended tire pressure on a sticker inside the driver’s side door. Car manufacturers spend a lot of time coming up with this number, and it’s the one you should use.</p></div>\n<p>Tire pressure is something you have to keep your eye on, as it constantly changes as the tires log miles and the temperature fluctuates. That’s why it’s so important to check it regularly and add air when needed. Some experts say you should do this at every gas fill-up, but just as with the oil check, every other fill-up should be enough to catch any deficiencies before they become big problems.</p>\n<p>Checking your tire pressure takes less than two minutes. Here’s how to do it:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>For an accurate reading, always check tire pressure when your tires are “cold,”</strong> that is before you’ve driven around on them. I only check my tires’ pressure at a gas station when I fill up at the one less than a mile from my house, first thing in the morning. If you’ve already been driving around for awhile, let the tires “rest” for at least four hours before checking the pressure.<br>\n<strong></strong></li>\n<li><strong>Find out the tire pressure recommended for your car (it’s in your owner’s manual and on a panel inside the driver’s side door, as picture above). </strong>Always fill the tires to this recommended level, regardless of tire brand, and not to the max PSI found on the tire sidewall – that number indicates the maximum pressure the tire needs to carry its heaviest load, not the tire’s ideal PSI.</li>\n<li><strong>Check tire pressure with tire pressure gauge</strong></li>\n<li><strong>Fill when needed</strong></li>\n</ul>\n<div>\n<p><strong>3. Check oil level and top off as needed. </strong>Motor oil is essential to your car’s performance. Its most important job is to lubricate all the moving parts in your engine so they don’t grind and tear themselves into dysfunction. It also transfers heat away from the combustion cycle and traps and holds all the nasty byproducts of combustion, sending it to the oil filter. If your engine doesn’t have enough oil, your car is at risk of going kaput.</p>\n<p>To ensure your car always has enough oil, it’s important to get in the habit of regularly checking it. Your owner’s manual probably recommends that you do this at every gas fill-up, but every other is typically sufficient. Checking your car’s oil level is super easy. All you need is a clean paper towel, adequate light, and about three minutes. You should save this job for last because you need to wait about five minutes after you turn the engine off for the oil to drain back into the pan:</p>\n<div style=\"width:510px\"><img title=\"IMG_1148\" src=\"http://content.artofmanliness.com/uploads//2012/08/IMG_1148.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"500\" height=\"333\"><p>Before checking your oil level, make sure your car is on level ground so you get an accurate reading. Locate your engine’s dipstick. It usually has an image of an oil can or just says “OIL.”</p></div>\n<div style=\"width:510px\"><img title=\"IMG_1149\" src=\"http://content.artofmanliness.com/uploads//2012/08/IMG_1149.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"500\" height=\"333\"><p>Pull the dipstick out. No snickering.</p></div>\n<div style=\"width:510px\"><img title=\"IMG_1150\" src=\"http://content.artofmanliness.com/uploads//2012/08/IMG_1150.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"500\" height=\"333\"><p>Wipe it clean with a paper towel. The gas station usually has some available near the pumps.</p></div>\n<div style=\"width:510px\"><img title=\"IMG_1153\" src=\"http://content.artofmanliness.com/uploads//2012/08/IMG_1153.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"500\" height=\"333\"><p>Back goes the dip stick. Make sure it goes all the way in.</p></div>\n<div style=\"width:510px\"><img title=\"IMG_1156\" src=\"http://content.artofmanliness.com/uploads//2012/08/IMG_1156.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"500\" height=\"333\"><p>Now, we’re actually going to check the oil level. Pull the dipstick out again, but don’t turn it upside down to look at it. This makes the oil run upward and ruins your reading. The dipstick will have two marks at the bottom. They are usually either lines or holes in the stick. Mine has two holes. The oil level can be read by looking where the oily part ends and the dry part begins. If the oil line is between the two marks, you’re good to go. If it’s below the bottom mark, you need to add some more oil.  Just a quart mind you.  You should never add more than a quart at once without driving and taking a new reading of the oil level. Too much oil isn’t good for the engine.  There you go. You just read a dipstick.</p></div>\n<p>Most cars are designed to consume a bit of oil between changes, and many manufacturers consider a consumption rate of one quart every 1,000 miles to be normal. Some cars lose more than that because of leaks or because the engine is burning oil along with the gasoline. If you’re needing to add a quart of oil every 500 miles or so, you should take your car in ASAP to get it checked for external and internal leaks.</p>\n</div>\n<h3><strong>Follow the Maintenance Schedule Suggested in Your Vehicle’s Owner’s Manual</strong></h3>\n<p>Your vehicle also requires maintenance tasks that are performed less frequently, but are vital to allowing your automobile to live a long and fruitful life. These tasks include oil changes, tire rotations, replacing transmission fluid, and the like.</p>\n<p>Don’t follow the dealer’s or mechanics’ recommended maintenance schedule. They often suggest that you come in more frequently and perform maintenance that you really don’t need. For example, most quick lube and dealership service shops recommend you bring your car in every 3,000 miles for an oil change, despite the fact that most modern engines are designed to run for 5,000 miles before needing one. Another example is coolant replacement. A lot of mechanics recommend having it replaced every 30,000 miles, but many vehicles don’t need this service until they reach four times that. And after the 120k mark, manufacturers often recommend the coolant be replaced only every 60,000 miles.</p>\n<p>Instead of relying on Larry at the KwikLube to tell you when you should service your car, pop open your glove compartment (or “jockey box” for you gents living in the Mountain West region), and pull out your owner’s manual.  There should be a section where it lists the manufacturer’s recommended maintenance schedule, which tells you how often to get your oil changed, rotate the tires, and replace fluids and parts. If you can’t find the owner’s manual, a quick Google search will bring it up. By following your vehicle’s ideal maintenance schedule, you can prevent costly inspections, repairs, and replacements, and keep your car humming for many years.</p>\n<h3><strong>DIY Car Maintenance </strong></h3>\n<p>As newer vehicles have become increasingly complex with onboard computers and high-tech gadgetry, maintenance jobs now often require a mechanic with the proper training and tools to correctly complete the task.</p>\n<p>But there are still a few maintenance jobs that most men can do themselves on most models, and below I list three of the most accessible. It’s true that taking care of these tasks doesn’t save you very much in either time or money, but it is satisfying nonetheless and I recommend trying each job at least once, as they’ll give you a reason to look under your hood as well as a small bit of insight into how your trusted chariot works.</p>\n<p><strong>Change oil every 5,000 miles. </strong><a href=\"http://artofmanliness.com/2009/10/29/how-to-change-your-motor-oil/\">We’ve written a guide on how to change your car’s motor oil yourself</a>. But for those living in an apartment or dorm, this might not be an option. Whether you do it yourself or take it to a mechanic, getting your oil changed regularly is one of the most important ways of keeping your car running smoothly.</p>\n<p><strong>Change air filter every 12,000 miles. </strong>This is quite possibly one of the easiest car maintenance jobs you can do yourself. We wrote how to do it <a href=\"http://artofmanliness.com/2010/09/23/how-to-change-your-cars-air-filter/\">here</a>. Regularly changing your car’s air filter will increase fuel efficiency, prolong your engine’s life, and reduce emissions.</p>\n<p>While changing your car’s oil comes with the hassle of finding a way to dispose of the used oil properly, no such inconvenience exists for the air filter, and doing it yourself will easily save you half the cost of having a service shop take care of it.</p>\n<p><strong>Rotate tires every 5,000 to 10,000 miles. </strong>Front and rear tires wear differently. Regularly rotating your tires equalizes their natural wear patterns, ensuring a smoother and safer ride. It also extends the life of your tires, which will save you money on costly replacements. Here’s<a href=\"http://artofmanliness.com/2009/12/08/how-to-rotate-your-car-tires/\"> how to rotate your car tires.</a></p>\n<h3><strong>Keep Your Car Clean</strong></h3>\n<p>Besides performing regular maintenance, another important part of taking care of your car is keeping it clean.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://artofmanliness.com/2012/04/25/driveway-car-wash/\"><strong>Wash your car regularly</strong></a><strong>. </strong>Every day our cars are subjected to sun, salt, grease and grime, acid rain, smog, tree sap, dead bugs, and worst of all, the acidic compound of bird poop bombs. These things eat away at paint, and once that’s gone, they will eat at the metal in your car. While failing to wash your car won’t result in immediate damage, over time the elements will corrode your vehicle, along with its potential re-sell value.</p>\n<p>How often should you wash your car? It depends. Location and climate are the two biggest factors in determining frequency. If you live in an area with a lot of pollution and sea salt in the air, you’ll need to wash it two or three times a month. If you live inland and in an area with little pollution, a once a month car wash will suffice. During the winter, you may need to wash your car more frequently than you do during the summer due to the snow, salt, and mud that will accumulate as you drive along icy roadways.</p>\n<p>Don’t forget <a href=\"http://artofmanliness.com/2012/07/18/car-detailing/\">to detail your car</a> after you wash it!</p>\n<p><strong>Don’t use the inside of your car as a garbage can. </strong> The inside of your car is not a garbage can, so quit treating it like one. Get in the habit of regularly cleaning out your car so it doesn’t constantly look like a dump. Keeping your car’s interior clean and tidy can reduce stress in your life and make the driving experience more enjoyable. Also, you never know when you’ll have unexpected passengers . By keeping your car clean, you’ll never have to sheepishly say, “Sorry about the mess,” as you wipe away shards of yesterday’s QuickTrip breakfast burrito from the passenger seat.</p>\n<p><em><strong>Any other car maintenance tips for a young man headed out on his own?

So go buy the toilet guts.  You can get them almost anywhere.  No need to be a plumber, just go to the local hardware store and ask for toilet guts (or something like that). They are almost always sold as one unit, and they’re inexpensive enough that you can replace the whole thing easier than replacing specific parts.  You may also decide to replace the supply hose, since you’re already messing around there.</p>\n<p>You can spend a lot or a little.  The expensive ones are quieter, but other than that, it doesn’t matter.  Fifteen bucks will do the job.  <em>It’s a toilet.</em></p>\n<h3><strong>Remove Old Toilet Guts</strong></h3>\n<p><strong>1)  Pee.</strong>  The sound of all that water flowing will no doubt cause an increase in urgency.</p>\n<p><strong>2)  Disconnect the flushing handle from the stopper on the inside.</strong>  It should be a simple chain or other mechanism you can do by hand.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://artofmanliness.com/2012/08/19/heading-out-on-your-own-day-19-fix-a-running-toilet/toilet-036/\" rel=\"attachment wp-att-26734\"><img title=\"toilet-036\" src=\"http://content.artofmanliness.com/uploads//2012/08/toilet-036.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"500\" height=\"350\"></a></p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Note the crusties around the top of the drain tube.  Just some calcium, not part of the pipe.  It’ll break right off.   If you’re highly anal you can nuke the whole tank with vinegar.  That said…it’s a <em>toilet</em>.</p>\n<p><strong>3)  Shut off the water.</strong>  The valve below the toilet gets very little use.  Sometimes it’s a little corroded or encrusted with hard water minerals, since the last time it was used was when the toilet was installed or the mechanism replaced.  A little vinegar and a soft wire brush can clean it up a little.  Close it tightly.  Place an old towel or two under the faucet to catch water when you unhook the supply hose.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://artofmanliness.com/2012/08/19/heading-out-on-your-own-day-19-fix-a-running-toilet/toilet-030/\" rel=\"attachment wp-att-26731\"><img title=\"toilet-030\" src=\"http://content.artofmanliness.com/uploads//2012/08/toilet-030.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"500\" height=\"350\"></a></p>\n<p><strong>4)  Drain the tank.</strong>  Easy to do–flush the toilet by reaching in and pulling the stopper up.  The tank will not refill because you shut the water off.  To keep things a little neater, you could sponge out the remaining water and wring it into the bowl.  It makes for less dripping later.</p>\n<p>You’ll notice I use braided steel-covered supply lines.  They’re probably overkill, but it’s cheap insurance.  Your mileage may vary.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://artofmanliness.com/2012/08/19/heading-out-on-your-own-day-19-fix-a-running-toilet/toilet-043/\" rel=\"attachment wp-att-26741\"><img title=\"toilet-043\" src=\"http://content.artofmanliness.com/uploads//2012/08/toilet-043.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"500\" height=\"350\"></a></p>\n<p><strong>5)  Loosen the supply hose at the valve</strong>.  Use a proper wrench…not a crescent wrench.  Let it drain into a small pan.  Then loosen the supply hose at the fitting under the tank. This is usually a plastic nut or wing nut that you can hand-tighten or loosen.  If it’s really stuck, carefully use a pair of Channel Locks to urge it along.  Proceed carefully here.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://artofmanliness.com/2012/08/19/heading-out-on-your-own-day-19-fix-a-running-toilet/toilet-035/\" rel=\"attachment wp-att-26733\"><img title=\"toilet-035\" src=\"http://content.artofmanliness.com/uploads//2012/08/toilet-035.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"500\" height=\"350\"></a></p>\n<p><strong>6)  Loosen the big, plastic nut under the tank where the supply hose entered.</strong>  It’s a bigger plastic knob that attaches the guts on the inside of the toilet.  Water will leak out here, but it’s clean water, just like from the tap.  Continue to loosen it and remove the guts.</p>\n<p><strong>7)  Pull off the old stopper thing.</strong></p>\n<p>Congrats, your toilet is now dry and useless.  Time to fix that problem.  Here’s the dead one below.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://artofmanliness.com/2012/08/19/heading-out-on-your-own-day-19-fix-a-running-toilet/toilet-038/\" rel=\"attachment wp-att-26736\"><img title=\"toilet-038\" src=\"http://content.artofmanliness.com/uploads//2012/08/toilet-038.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"500\" height=\"350\"></a></p>\n<h3><strong>Install New Toilet Guts</strong></h3>\n<p><strong>1)  Reinstall the new guts by dropping it through the hole in the tank.</strong>  There should be quite a bit of gasketing here.  Make sure the area is clean so the new gasket seals properly.  Get a friend to hold it in place while you tighten the big nut underneath the tank.  If you overtighten it, you might crack the plastic, so just go until it’s snug.</p>\n<p>Proper building code says that the overflow tube has to be at least an inch above the full level.  Different assemblies adjust differently.  This one adjusts by twisting the whole mechanism and sliding it up and down, then twisting to lock it.  The float is internal in that white part that sticks off to the side of the water feed.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://artofmanliness.com/2012/08/19/heading-out-on-your-own-day-19-fix-a-running-toilet/toilet-046/\" rel=\"attachment wp-att-26744\"><img title=\"toilet-046\" src=\"http://content.artofmanliness.com/uploads//2012/08/toilet-046.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"500\" height=\"350\"></a></p>\n<p><strong>2)  Attach the supply hose to the bottom of the tank</strong>.  Finger tight only, but do turn it until it stops. No need to use Teflon tape here; it’s plastic to plastic.  No wrenches.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://artofmanliness.com/2012/08/19/heading-out-on-your-own-day-19-fix-a-running-toilet/toilet-027/\" rel=\"attachment wp-att-26729\"><img title=\"toilet-027\" src=\"http://content.artofmanliness.com/uploads//2012/08/toilet-027.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"500\" height=\"350\"></a></p>\n<p><strong>3)  Attach the supply hose to the faucet.</strong>  Here it’s metal to metal, so use a bit of Teflon tape.  Just wrap the threads, then re-attach.  Non-crescent wrenches work best.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://artofmanliness.com/2012/08/19/heading-out-on-your-own-day-19-fix-a-running-toilet/toilet-042/\" rel=\"attachment wp-att-26740\"><img title=\"toilet-042\" src=\"http://content.artofmanliness.com/uploads//2012/08/toilet-042.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"500\" height=\"350\"></a></p>\n<p><strong>4)  Turn the water on, check for leaks.</strong>  Your fill hose should squirt into the overflow as noted. The tank won’t fill here, you’re just checking your connections.  Turn the water off.</p>\n<p><strong>5)  Install your new stopper thing by pushing the plastic studs on the overflow tube through the soft rubber of the flapper.</strong>  It should go on easy.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://artofmanliness.com/2012/08/19/heading-out-on-your-own-day-19-fix-a-running-toilet/toilet-045/\" rel=\"attachment wp-att-26743\"><img title=\"toilet-045\" src=\"http://content.artofmanliness.com/uploads//2012/08/toilet-045.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"500\" height=\"350\"></a></p>\n<p><strong>6)  Reattach the chain from the stopper to the toilet handle, adjusting the chain so it is as taut as possible without lifting the stopper.</strong>  Test by flushing a few times.  The stopper should drop on its seat when the water reaches the bottom of the tank.  If it doesn’t, adjust it a little until it does so consistently. When it doesn’t seat, that’s when you have to jiggle the handle to get it to do so. That’s what we’re trying to avoid.</p>\n<p><strong>7)  Clean up.</strong> There will be black goo on things.  That’s not what you think it is — it’s just deposits that form inside the tank over time.</p>\n<p>That’s it.  Your toilet is now operational again, simple as that.  Drink a few beverages of your choice and test it again.  Congratulate yourself on a job well done.</p>\n<p><strong>To fix another common toilet-related problem–<a href=\"http://artofmanliness.com/2009/09/03/how-to-unclog-a-toilet/\">how to unclog one–see this AoM post.</a></strong></p>\n<p>No related posts.</p><p><iframe src=\"http://feedads.g.doubleclick.net/~ah/f/f3iv4dtffn7nla1icg3h2et32g/468/60#http%3A%2F%2Fartofmanliness.com%2F2012%2F08%2F19%2Fheading-out-on-your-own-day-19-fix-a-running-toilet%2F\" width=\"100%\" height=\"60\" frameborder=\"0\" scrolling=\"no\" marginwidth=\"0\" marginheight=\"0\"></iframe></p><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/TheArtOfManliness/~4/-dceHcSyyss\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\">"

The process can be a bit intimidating for a first time renter. Below we take you through the steps of finding an apartment, navigating the legalese of the lease agreement, as well as managing your rights as a tenant. Let’s do this.</p>\n<h3><strong>Finding an Apartment</strong></h3>\n<p><strong>Figure out how much you can afford. </strong>Take a look at your monthly income. Experts recommend only spending between 25%-35% of your after-tax income on rent and housing. So let’s say your pay after taxes is $1,500 a month. Ideally, you shouldn’t pay more than $525 a month on rent.</p>\n<p>You also need to take into account that you may be responsible for some of the utility costs of your rental. So you’ll need to figure in another $100+ to cover those costs.</p>\n<p>Keep in mind that some apartments have income requirements that will put you out of the running altogether.</p>\n<p>If you can’t find a place within your budget, consider getting a <a href=\"http://artofmanliness.com/2012/08/08/rules-for-roommates/\">roommate</a>.</p>\n<p><strong>Create criteria for your ideal apartment. </strong>What are you looking for in an apartment? Do you want a studio or a single bedroom? Maybe you want to rent a small house? Do you need the apartment to come with appliances, including washer and dryer? Do want it to be close to school or your work? Do want it to be within walking distance of retail, like groceries or coffee shops? Are you willing to live in a neighborhood known for its crime levels?</p>\n<p>Write down whatever comes to your mind. While you might not be able to get everything on your apartment wish list, it will definitely help in narrowing down the possibilities.</p>\n<p><strong>Identify potential apartments. </strong>With your list of criteria in hand, hop online and start searching for apartments.  When Kate and I looked for an apartment here in Tulsa, I simply began the search by Googling: “Tulsa apartments for rent.” Google actually brings up a map that pinpoints apartments or homes for rent in your city. That map makes narrowing down potentials pretty easy because you can see if the apartments are close to work or school, near grocery stores, or are in safe areas of town.</p>\n<p>Once you narrow apartments down by location, check to see if they have the things you’re looking for in a rental, i.e. appliances, number of bedrooms, etc. Most big apartment complexes have a web page where you can look at floor plans, the amenities they offer, and the cost of rent.  Smaller units might only have a phone number. Give those apartments a call and ask about their available units and cost.</p>\n<p>Don’t just limit your search to Google. Make sure to hop on Craigslist to find homes or apartments that might be for rent by individual owners as opposed to bigger companies.</p>\n<p>A couple of other good sources for finding potential apartments are rental magazines that you can pick-up for free at supermarkets and <a href=\"http://www.rent.com/\">rent.com</a>. If you find your apartment using the latter, they’ll send you a $100 gift card. Bonus!</p>\n<p><strong>Set aside a day to visit your potentials. </strong> You’ll want to visit your potential rental units in person to see their condition and possibly submit a rental application. Make this process as efficient as possible by visiting as many of your potentials as you can in a single day. Saturdays are the busiest days for landlords showing apartments, so try to go sometime during the week. It’s best to call the landlords and set up an appointment with them, but if you can’t, most buildings will give you a tour anyway. You’ll want to set aside about 45 minutes for each visit, so plan your appointments accordingly.</p>\n<h3><strong>Visiting Prospective Rentals</strong></h3>\n<p><img title=\"vintageapartment\" src=\"http://content.artofmanliness.com/uploads//2012/08/vintageapartment.jpeg\" alt=\"\" width=\"500\" height=\"490\"></p>\n<p><strong>Make a good first impression. </strong>When you visit a potential apartment, the landlord or apartment manager will be evaluating you just like you’re evaluating them. They want to make sure the people they rent to are reliable, courteous, and easy to get along with. Your first impression starts with the phone call to set up the appointment. Be polite and speak clearly.</p>\n<p>When you actually go visit the apartment, dress for the occasion. While you don’t have to wear a shirt and tie, you shouldn’t come rolling in to your appointment wearing sweatpants and a crummy t-shirt. Nice jeans and a polo will work well.</p>\n<p>Be on time! If you show up late to your appointment, the manager or landlord could take that as a sign you may be late in paying rent.</p>\n<p>When you meet the manager or landlord, offer a firm handshake, a warm smile, and thank them for meeting with you.</p>\n<p>As you look at the rental unit, keep your comments positive and your possible complaints close to your vest. No need to spout off a list of upgrades and requests before you’re even offered the place. That will just scare landlords away from you. Wait to bring up your concerns until after you’ve been accepted as a renter.</p>\n<p><strong>Check for problems. </strong>As you walk through the apartment, check the following things, but again, don’t broadcast your concerns right away:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Look for signs of mold, mildew, and insect infestation.</li>\n<li>Open and close all the doors and windows, and also check that the locks function properly.</li>\n<li>Flush the toilet and run the water in the sinks and showers. Pay attention to water pressure and temperature.</li>\n<li>Look for obvious damage like broken fixtures, holes in walls, broken tile, etc.</li>\n<li>Check for wear and tear in the carpet.</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>Ask questions. </strong>While you should keep small concerns to yourself about the unit while looking at it, feel free to ask the landlord or apartment manager any questions you might have that will help in your decision. Here are some possible questions you may consider asking:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>What’s the monthly rent?</li>\n<li>Are any utilities included with the rent?</li>\n<li>How much is the security deposit?</li>\n<li>When is rent due? Do you have auto-pay?</li>\n<li>What’s the make-up of the other tenants? Are they mainly younger students? Married couples with families? Older folks?</li>\n<li>Have you had any break-ins in the past year? Are car break-ins a problem?</li>\n<li>What’s the parking situation like? Do you pay for a parking spot?</li>\n<li>Do you take care of small maintenance issues or am I responsible for some of the repairs in the apartment?</li>\n<li>Am I able to re-paint the walls or make other modifications?</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Again, be friendly and polite when you ask these questions. No need to be combative.</p>\n<p><strong>Ask current tenants about their experience. </strong>Online apartment reviews are pretty worthless in my experience. It seems the only people who leave reviews are folks who had a bad experience with the landlord or apartment manager. And when you read the reviews, you often get the sense that this person is a little unhinged and probably had a hand in creating the problem they’re griping about in the first place.</p>\n<p>To get a better idea of what it’s like to rent at a particular complex, it’s best to ask current tenants. When you’re visiting, and don’t have a person from their office by your side, ask any tenants you may run into about their experience living there. Is the landlord easy to work with? Are they responsive to repair requests? Do they feel safe living here? Are the neighbors quiet and friendly?</p>\n<h3><strong>Filling Out the Rental Application</strong></h3>\n<p>When you find a place you like, you’ll likely have to fill out a rental application. Landlords and apartment managers use the application to screen potential renters. The application will ask about your employment and monthly income as well as your rental history. You’ll also be asked to sign a consent form giving permission to the landlord to run a background and credit check. Be completely truthful when filling out the application! Any fibs on it will likely be discovered during the background check, resulting in your application ending up in the trashcan.</p>\n<p>And to be clear: submitting a rental obligation in no way obligates you to anything. If the manager approves it, you’ll then be asked to come in to the apartment office to sign a lease.</p>\n<p><strong>Check your credit history before submitting a rental application. </strong>Landlords are allowed by law to check the <a href=\"http://artofmanliness.com/2012/08/11/understanding-credit/\">credit histories</a> of potential renters to screen for people who are or aren’t likely to pay rent on time. If they see that you’ve had trouble paying bills on time, that’s a red flag that they shouldn’t rent to you. It’s good to check your credit history before submitting an application so you can correct any mistakes that may adversely affect you in the rental process.</p>\n<p><strong>Be ready to pay a rental application fee. </strong> Landlords are allowed to charge you an application fee to cover the cost of the credit check. The fee should be in the $20-$30 range; anything more, and you’re probably getting ripped off. If you’re submitting multiple rental applications, the credit check fees can quickly start adding up. To curtail those costs, you might consider getting your credit report yourself and making copies of it to give to landlords. Some may insist on requesting the report themselves, out of worry that you may have doctored the copy to make it look better than it actually is. But you may be able to persuade a few to accept your copy, thus saving you some money. It doesn’t hurt to try.</p>\n<p><strong>Have a list of references ready. </strong>You’ll be asked to provide a list of personal and professional references. Have those ready and make sure to tell your references they should expect a call from a landlord.</p>\n<h3><strong>Signing the Lease (or Rental Agreement)</strong></h3>\n<p>After your rental application has been approved, the landlord will ask you to come to the office and sign a lease. This is where you can bring up any concerns you had about the rental unit, as well as negotiate for better terms or perks. You need to be on your game during this time, because once you sign your name on that dotted line, you’re pretty much stuck with the terms written in the lease.</p>\n<p><strong>Have enough money in your checking account to cover the security deposit and first month’s rent. </strong>When you sign your lease, the landlord will usually ask that you pay a security deposit as well as the first month’s rent. Make sure you have enough money in available (they may only take cash, money order, or debit card) to cover both amounts. The security deposit will be stored in a savings account during the term of your lease. If you terminate the lease early or leave the apartment in disrepair, the landlord will use the security deposit to cover those costs. If you leave the apartment in the same condition as you got it, you can get your security deposit back. More on that later.</p>\n<p><strong>Difference between a lease and a rental agreement. </strong>Leases and rental agreements are pretty much the same thing except for one thing: time. Rental agreements typically go from month-to-month, while leases last for a longer period of time, usually a year. Landlords are free to raise the rent at the end of each month when a rental agreement expires; leases lock in the rate of rent for an entire year.</p>\n<p>If you know that you’ll only be in the apartment for a short period of time, ask for a rental agreement; if you plan on staying in your place for at least a year, get a lease.</p>\n<p><strong>Read the lease or rental agreement before signing! </strong> Don’t sign anything until you’ve read through the lease line-by-line. You want to know exactly what you’re getting into when you agree to rent from a landlord. Make note of anything you find disagreeable, and ask questions about what you don’t understand. As you read through the rent, look for the provisions that answer the following questions:</p>\n<blockquote style=\"border:0px;background-color:#ffffff\"><p><strong>How much is rent? </strong>Duh.</p>\n<p><strong>How much is the security deposit and how can you get it back? </strong>Understand what sort of condition you’ll need to leave the apartment in if you want to get your security deposit back.</p>\n<p><strong>What’s the term of the tenancy?  </strong>Month-to-month? Nine months? One year?</p>\n<p><strong>What happens at the end of the lease? </strong>When the term of the lease is up, what do you have to do to renew it? How much will the landlord increase your rent by? If the lease is up, but you still need a place to stay for a month or two, can you ask that the lease convert to a month-to-month rental agreement?</p>\n<p><strong>What happens if you terminate your lease early? </strong>This an important provision to check. Sure, you may plan to stay in your apartment for a year, but plans can change and you’ll have to terminate your lease early. Most apartments will ask for 30 to 60 days notice if you plan on terminating the lease early. Pay attention to see if there are any termination fees. Under the law in most states, you are legally responsible to pay the landlord <em>only</em> for the actual loss in rent that your early termination caused. So if you move out early, and it took the landlord a month to find another renter, you’d be responsible for one month’s rent.</p>\n<p>Many corporately managed complexes will try sneak in clauses saying you have to pay two or three months rent for ending a lease early. Because they can often fill the vacancy quickly, they end up scoring a huge windfall — they have two months rent from you, plus rent from the new guy. That’s illegal in most states. If you see termination fees like that in the lease, try to get them deleted or modified before you sign. Forfeiting your security deposit and paying a month’s rent is usually a reasonable termination fee.</p>\n<p><strong>If you have signed with a roommate, are you jointly and severally liable? </strong>Usually when you sign a lease with a roommate, the lease will state that each co-signer is jointly and severally liable. This means if your roommate doesn’t pay his share of the rent or moves out before the end of the lease, <em>you</em> are still on the hook for the full amount of the rent.</p>\n<p><strong>Where, how, and when is rent paid and what happens if you’re late on rent? </strong>You’d be surprised, but some landlords are really particular about how rent is paid. They want it in a certain form (check, credit card, etc.) and deposited in a certain place. Make sure you know where and how this is to take place. Also make sure the lease is clear on <em>when</em> rent is due and what happens if you pay late. Most landlords will charge a fee on late payments.</p>\n<p><strong>Which utilities are you responsible for? </strong>Some landlords cover the costs of all utilities, while others cover none. Many will have arrangements where they’ll pay the water bill, but then tack on your portion of the bill to your monthly rent.</p>\n<p><strong>Is subletting allowed? </strong>Let’s say you take a three-month trip during the summer. You have a friend who needs a place to stay during that same three-month period. Instead of leaving your apartment vacant for three months, you offer to let your friend stay in your place as long as he pays you the amount of monthly rent so that you can pay the landlord. You just sublet. Most landlords prohibit subletting, but some allow it. If you think you’ll need to be able to sublet to someone else, make sure the lease allows you to.</p>\n<p><strong>Are you allowed to make alterations to the dwelling? </strong>You’re not the owner of the property, so you can’t replace counters or paint the walls without the landlord’s permission. Most places I’ve rented from allow you to paint the walls, as long as you paint them back to the original color before you move out.</p>\n<p><strong>Are you responsible for minor repairs or is your landlord? </strong>While landlords are required by law to make repairs that ensure the dwelling is habitable, they’re not required to take care of minor repairs, and may leave that to you to take care of. Most large apartment complexes will fix just about anything in your unit. In leases with individual landlords you’ll often see clauses stating that the renter is responsible for minor repairs.</p>\n<p><strong>Are pets allowed, and if so, do you have to pay an extra fee for having one? </strong>Some apartments allow pets (often with size restrictions); some don’t. The ones that do, often charge an extra monthly fee.</p>\n<p><strong>Is smoking allowed? </strong>Landlords are allowed to prohibit smoking in their units. If you’re a smoker, you’ll want to know that before you sign the lease.</p></blockquote>\n<p><strong>Get any oral promises in writing. </strong>If the landlord made any oral promises to you while you were looking at the apartment, get those promises written in the lease.<br>\n<strong>Feel free to negotiate and delete any of these terms. </strong>If you see any terms you don’t like, ask to have them modified. Also, feel free to negotiate the rent amount or security deposit. Before you and the landlord sign the lease, anything is fair game to change in the contract.</p>\n<h3><strong>Inspect the Apartment Before Taking Possession</strong></h3>\n<p>Before you take possession of the apartment, the landlord should give you a Landlord-Tenant Checklist that lists all the rooms, fixtures, and appliances in the apartment. Inspect the apartment and make note of the condition of the various items on the list. If you notice any damage, make sure to photograph it, and point it out to the landlord or manager. Be as thorough as possible during this inspection. This will protect you from forfeiting your security deposit for damage that already existed before you took possession.</p>\n<h3><strong>Get Renter’s Insurance</strong></h3>\n<p>Renter’s insurance covers any loss to your personal property due to robbery or accidents. It also covers any damage you might cause to other tenant’s property. For example, let’s say your washing machine springs a leak and water seeps through the floor and ruins your neighbor’s antique dresser. Renter’s insurance would cover that.</p>\n<p>When you sign your lease, your landlord may strongly suggest and even hint that you’re legally required to get renter’s insurance. Their concern isn’t for your benefit. The landlord wants <em>your</em> insurance policy to pay for any damage or injury that your negligence causes instead of the aggrieved party suing the landlord.   While you’re not required to have renter’s insurance in most states (except Virginia), it’s a good idea to get it anyway. As Woodrow Call from <em>Lonesome Dove </em>would say: “better to have it and not need it, then to need it and not have it.” Renter’s insurance will set you back about $15-25 a month, less if you tack it onto another policy (like auto) you have with an insurance company.</p>\n<h3><strong>Your Rights and Responsibilities as a Renter</strong></h3>\n<p>Court cases and state statutes have established rights and responsibilities that you have as a renter. If your landlord violates any of these rights, you’re entitled to recourse.</p>\n<p><strong>Renter’s Rights</strong></p>\n<p><strong>You have the right to a habitable premise. </strong>While you’re not entitled to five-star amenities, you do have the right to rent a place that’s habitable. What constitutes a habitable premise? Case law and statutes generally define it as having the following attributes:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>safe structural elements including floors, walls, roofs, and secure doors and windows</li>\n<li>all electrical, plumbing, heating, and air conditioning systems function</li>\n<li>working hot and cold water</li>\n<li>exterminating infestations of rodents and other insects</li>\n<li>access to trash receptacles</li>\n</ul>\n<p>If your apartment ever suffers any defects that make your place inhabitable (like sewage backing up in your bathtub), your landlord has a duty to fix it. While some apartments let you make online requests for repairs, as well as provide a phone number for “emergencies,” always make sure you document your request in some way. The landlord will then have a certain amount of time to make those repairs. If they don’t, you have several re-courses, such as withholding rent until the repairs are made or paying someone to fix the problem and then deducting the cost of repair from your rent. It’s when you decide to go those routes, that having your communications with your landlord well documented becomes so important.</p>\n<p><strong>You have the right to privacy. </strong>While the landlord owns the property, they can’t barge in anytime they want. All states have laws stating renters have a right to privacy while renting. Pretty much the only time the landlord can come into your rental without permission or notice is when they’re responding to an emergency that threatens injury or property damage.</p>\n<p>Any other time the landlord wants to enter your apartment, they need to have your permission and in some cases give you 24-hours notice before entering. Some landlords or apartment managers will try to bully you into giving permission. Don’t give in. If your landlord bugs more than is reasonably necessary and fails to comply with requests to leave you alone, you can sue your landlord for invasion of privacy or breach of “<a href=\"http://legal-dictionary.thefreedictionary.com/Quiet+enjoyment\">implied covenant of quiet enjoyment</a>.”</p>\n<p><strong>You have the right to a safe premise. </strong>The landlord can’t prevent all crimes or accidents that occur on their premises, but if the crime or injury occurred <em>because</em> of the landlord’s negligence, you can sue them for any damages or costs you may have incurred.</p>\n<h3><strong>Renter Responsibilities</strong></h3>\n<p>In addition to the provisions in the lease agreement, many states have statutes on the books listing the responsibilities of the renter.</p>\n<p><strong>Keep the premise clean, safe, and in good repair. </strong>This is the most common responsibility you’ll see listed in statutes. Basically, you’re required by law to take care of the apartment while you’re a tenant there. Not too hard.</p>\n<p><strong>Reimburse the landlord for any damages you may cause. </strong>If you don’t keep the apartment clean, safe, and in good repair, you have the responsibility of reimbursing the landlord to make the apartment clean, safe, and in good repair again.</p>\n<h3><strong>Getting Your Safety Deposit Back When You Move Out</strong></h3>\n<p>So your lease is up and you’re ready to move on to greener pastures. How do you get that $500 security deposit back? In my experience, most landlords will try to do anything to ensure that they don’t pay back your deposit.</p>\n<p>First, clean your apartment as well as you can, including carpet cleaning, if possible (landlords will often clip you on this). Second, get your Tenant-Landlord Checklist that you filled out when you first moved in and run an inspection again with your landlord. You can’t be charged for ordinary wear and tear that comes with living in an apartment, but you can be for damage and excessive filth. <a href=\"http://www.nolo.com/legal-encyclopedia/chart-cleaning-repairs-landlord-deduct-29017.html\">Check out this chart</a> of what sort of wear and tear a landlord should pay for and what sort of damage they can deduct from your security deposit.</p>\n<p>If they try to charge you to replace something when a repair would be sufficient, object. Also, if you paid a cleaning a fee before moving in, your landlord can’t deduct your security deposit for any cleaning.</p>\n<p>If the landlord does have to deduct from your security deposit to replace and clean your apartment, you’re entitled to an itemized statement that explains the purpose of each deduction. If you think any of the amounts are excessive and unwarranted, push back and make your case. If your landlord won’t change his mind, unfortunately your only recourse is to take him to small claims court. Make sure you have everything well documented, though, should you choose to do this.</p>\n<p>The landlord has 14 to 30 days after you move out to return your security deposit.</p>\n<p><em><strong> Any other tips and advice for a first time renter?

For some men, these words don’t belong in the same breath as <em>manliness</em>. For them, etiquette and manners conjure up arbitrary lists of dos and don’ts, a nagging mother, or scenes of artificial formality, complete with images of bowing and scraping, the polishing of monocles, and a bunch of treacly, “How do you dos?” and “No, after yous!”</p>\n<p>It wasn’t always so. Our forbearers saw no contradiction in being ruggedly manly <em>and </em>a refined gentleman. For centuries, well-bred men were trained in <em>all </em>the manly arts, from the skills needed to be a soldier to the proper etiquette for dinner parties. They were quintessential gentlemen—dapper in dress, polite in conduct, and yet every bit a true man.</p>\n<p>George Washington, Theodore Roosevelt, and Robert E. Lee are some examples of men who combined gritty manliness with gentlemanly bearing. They paid attention to how they dressed, groomed, and conducted themselves and were as comfortable at a stately ball as they were on the battlefield. For these great men, having good manners did not make them <em>less</em> of a man, but <em>more</em> of one.</p>\n<p>This is because they saw good manners in the way Edward John Hardy, author of <em>Manners Makyth Man,</em> defined them: as<strong> </strong>“little morals,” “the shadows of virtues, if not virtues themselves.” <strong> If character was the root of inner manliness, then manners were the outer fruits that sprouted from the tree – the external behaviors and code of conduct that naturally followed from a life of virtue.</strong> These great men understood that while it is true that the rules of etiquette change over time and from culture to culture, <strong>the underlying principles of all manners remain constant: a respect for others, and a desire to treat all people with honesty and consideration – just as you’d like to be treated.</strong></p>\n<p>Still unconvinced? First let’s take a more specific look at some misconceptions about manners, and then at the reasons you should cultivate them.</p>\n<h3><strong>What Good Manners Are Not</strong></h3>\n<p>A young man’s negative opinion on manners sometimes springs from observing others practice them <em>badly</em>. But these are not true manners, for:</p>\n<p><strong>Good manners are not stiff, formal, or awkward.</strong> Good manners should come off as entirely natural. Some young men, knowing this and not wanting to seem like they’re trying too hard, swing the opposite way, and try so hard to be “natural” in their manners that they come off as even more contrived! Real naturalness comes from a few things:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><em>Forgetting yourself and concentrating on others. </em>The more you focus on making others comfortable, the less self-conscious you will feel, and the more comfortable you will become yourself.</li>\n<li><em>Catering your behavior to the crowd and event in which you find yourself.</em> Your manners should be more formal when visiting the White House than when eating at Chili’s.</li>\n<li><em>Practice.</em> Good manners shouldn’t be something you cram for in emergencies like studying for an exam. Rather, they should be a habit you develop through practice over time, like a leather coat that gets softer, more comfortable, and better-looking the more you wear it.</li>\n<li><em>Cultivating an inner sense of character</em>. This is most important. At its root, naturalness in manner springs from your sincerity and desire to treat people well for the right reasons; as mentioned above, it should be a natural extension of your character. Even if you do end up being a little awkward, if it comes from a sincere place, people will be very forgiving of it.</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>Good manners are not ostentatious.</strong> Good manners should never be showy or call attention to themselves. In fact they should not even be immediately noticeable in the moment and instead should create an overall positive impression, which the people with whom you interact only reflect on later: “I really enjoy his company.” “I had such a good time at his party.”</p>\n<p><strong>Good manners are not smug and judgmental.</strong> You don’t practice good manners to feel superior to others or to wield them as a club, policing people’s behavior.  As Charles Dickens once wrote: “My boy,” said a father to his son, “treat everyone with politeness—even those who are rude to you. For remember that you show courtesy to others <em>not because they are gentlemen, but because you are one.”</em></p>\n<h3><strong>Why Practice Good Manners?</strong></h3>\n<p><strong>Good manners give you confidence</strong>. Much of what constitutes good manners consists of common sense. Yet common sense can often fail us when we’re nervous, in unfamiliar territory, and just winging it. Look at manners as the signposts along the broad highway of common sense, guiding you in how to act and react in any situation, without veering off and getting lost in the thickets when you’re not sure what to do.</p>\n<p><strong>Good manners make a positive impression on others.</strong> A man with good manners makes enjoyable company, a welcome party guest, a referable contact, a trusted employee. Good manners attest to a man’s self-respect and self-control, qualities that apply to all areas of life. Plus, as good manners are in such short supply these days, they instantly put you head and shoulders above other young men out there.</p>\n<p><strong>Good manners add <em>texture</em> to life.</strong> In our day-to-day lives, we often just move from one thing to another, as each day bleeds into the next. Thus from time immemorial people have sought a break from the ordinary by creating festivals, rituals, <em>special</em> occasions. But special occasions aren’t special if we behave and dress exactly as we do in our everyday lives. Manners provide a unique texture to our lives, and contribute to adding a special atmosphere to special events – the solemnity of a funeral, the pomp of a wedding, the grace of a baptism, the significance of a graduation, even the escape of a movie. At the same time, creating this atmosphere is a community effort –with the guy in a t-shirt and shorts, the ringing of a cell phone, or the man walking in late, the spell is broken.</p>\n<p><strong>Good manners make things in life smoother, more pleasant, and more comfortable for everyone.</strong> Ironically, manners both add texture to life, and make our interactions smoother. Many old etiquette books described manners as the substance that “oils the creaking wheels of life.”  While we’d like to think that left to our own devices, everything would just flow naturally between people, without any guidelines on how to act – who does what and when – a whole lot of awkwardness and impoliteness ensues.</p>\n<p><strong>Good manners make other people feel comfortable.</strong> Ever been at a dinner where a guy brought up embarrassing stories from someone’s past, or insisted on pontificating about politics? Have you ever been with a friend who started talking to someone who was a stranger to you, but never stopped to introduce you to him, leaving you standing there awkwardly? “For what is a good manner?” William John Hardy wrote, “It is the art of putting our associates at their ease. Whoever makes the fewest persons uncomfortable is the best mannered man in the room.”</p>\n<p><strong>Good manners ultimately show respect for others</strong>. Do you like to wake up early to meet someone, only to have them be 20 minutes late? Do you enjoy it when your friend throws a tantrum after losing a round of golf? Would you like it if you made $2.50 an hour, busted your butt serving people, and then got stiffed on a tip? Do you appreciate being interrupted while you’re speaking? No? Then live the heart of good manners: the Golden Rule. Treat others with the same respect you’d like to be treated with.</p>\n<p>In summary, good manners make life richer and more enjoyable for you and for others. Unfortunately, many young men are raised with very little guidance on the proper manners to cultivate for different areas of their lives. The good news is that good manners can be learned by any young man no matter his background (and by any older man, no matter his age).</p>\n<p>We’ve written about the basics of etiquette extensively in the past, and while we still have a few areas to hit, have covered nearly all the essentials. So below we put together this etiquette study guide for a young man seeking to become a more dignified gentleman. Go through these links at your own pace, brushing up on the ins and outs of good manners, a little bit at a time.</p>\n<h3><strong>Essential Etiquette for Young Men</strong></h3>\n<p><strong><img

After 18 years of having almost all expenses taken care of, figuring out how to live within your means on your own can be downright overwhelming.</p>\n<p>I know I can remember a moment during my first month in an apartment by myself when I looked at all the bills I had due, and anxiously thought, “How in the heck am I going to pay for all this stuff?”</p>\n<p>What I needed, and what all young men who are living on their own for the first time need, was a budget.</p>\n<h3><strong>Why Create a Budget</strong></h3>\n<blockquote><p>“Interest never sleeps nor sickens nor dies; it never goes to the hospital; it works on Sundays and holidays; it never takes a vacation; it never visits nor travels; it takes no pleasure; it is never laid off work nor discharged from employment; it never works on reduced hours … Once in debt, interest is your companion every minute of the day and night; you cannot shun it or slip away from it; you cannot dismiss it; it yields neither to entreaties, demands, or orders; and whenever you get in its way or cross its course or fail to meet its demands, it crushes you.” –J. Rueben Clark Jr., “The Specter of Debt,” 1938</p></blockquote>\n<p>When you’re young and independent, your income is likely limited. You have to do all you can to stretch every last dollar. One tool that can assist you with that is a well thought out budget. A budget is basically a roadmap of your financial life. It allows you to plan your expenses so that you don’t spend more money than you have coming in.</p>\n<p>Without a budget, you may spend money on non-essential things early in the month and at the end of the month when bills come due, find that you don’t have the scratch to cover them. At this point you’re stuck, and may have to start charging things on your credit card to cover your outstanding expenses. Then, because you don’t budget the next month either, you won’t have the money to pay the balance on the card. Interest will start piling up, and you can soon easily find yourself in the enslaving grip of debt.</p>\n<p>Creating a budget gives you control over the feeling of chaos you may have about your finances. Staying out of debt always involves difficult choices; you can’t have it all. Creating a budget allows you to make informed, purposeful decisions as to how to allocate your money in the best possible way to reach your goals.</p>\n<h3><strong>How to Create a Budget by Hand</strong></h3>\n<p>Creating a budget by hand is pretty simple, but maintaining it can be difficult because of the discipline it requires. As I’ll explain below, I personally recommend the online service Mint for creating and sticking with a budget. But I wanted to put the pen and paper option out there, because 1) some folks like doing things by hand, 2) going through the steps on how to create an offline budget is a good way of learning the basic principles, regardless of format, and 3) even if you don’t plan on doing one by hand indefinitely, you might want to try it a few times in order to reinforce those principles.</p>\n<p><strong>1) Assess your monthly income. </strong>Gather your pay stubs together and figure out exactly how much you’re bringing in each month. If you’re self-employed or do work on the side, make a close estimate of how much you earn a month. You need to know how much money you have to work with before you start budgeting it out.<br>\n<strong><br>\n2) List your fixed expenses. </strong>Fixed expenses are those that stay roughly the same each month. They include things like rent, car insurance, car payments, health insurance, phone bill, and student loan payments.</p>\n<p><strong>3) Subtract your total fixed expenses from your total monthly income. </strong>The amount that’s left over is what you can work with for your variable expenses. If your fixed expenses are more than your total monthly income, you’re in trouble, as we haven’t even gotten to your variable expenses yet. Cut the cable, downgrade your cell phone plan, get a roommate to reduce rent costs, etc.</p>\n<p><strong>4) Set a spending goal for variable expenses. </strong>Now that you know how much money you have to work with, you can start budgeting for your variable expenses. These are the expenses that fluctuate from month-to-month. Unlike fixed expenses, you have a degree of control over variable expenses; these are the areas where you can cut back the most and start getting ahead in your finances. This type of spending includes items like groceries, utilities, gasoline, eating out, and entertainment. Set a reasonable spending goal for each variable expense.</p>\n<blockquote style=\"border:0px;background-color:#ffffff\"><p><strong><span style=\"color:#ff0000\">Start a Retirement and Emergency Fund</span> <em></em></strong></p>\n<p>When you’re just starting out in life, you’ll likely be living paycheck to paycheck, and will understandably want to spend the remains of your variable budget on doing fun things with your friends after taking care of the basics like gas and food.</p>\n<p>But as soon as you can swing it, make it a top priority to set aside a portion<em>, no matter how small</em>, to a retirement and an emergency fund. Let’s face it, when it comes to retirement we can no longer depend on our jobs or the government to fund it; who knows what the future of entitlements will bring? Set aside a small amount each month when possible and put it into a <a href=\"http://artofmanliness.com/2011/08/17/a-young-mans-guide-to-understanding-retirement-accounts-iras/\">Roth IRA</a> or <a href=\"http://artofmanliness.com/2011/07/19/a-young-mans-guide-to-understanding-retirement-accounts-the-401k/\">401K</a>.</p>\n<p>In addition to saving for retirement, budget some money each month for an <a href=\"http://artofmanliness.com/2011/03/23/why-and-how-to-start-an-emergency-fund/\">emergency fund</a>. This money is to be used when you find yourself unemployed or to pay for car repairs and other unforeseen expenses; having one will give you a great sense of confidence and security. Even if you can only sock away $25 a month in the beginning, it’s better than nothing. Most financial experts agree that you should save enough for three to six months of living expenses. That’s hard to do when you’re a young man, but again, just work on it slowly and do what you can. If you’re looking for a good place to stash your emergency fund, check out ING Direct. It’s an online bank, and they have better interest rates than traditional brick and mortar institutions. It’s what I use.</p></blockquote>\n<p><strong>5) Subtract your total expenses (fixed and variable) from your monthly income. </strong>The goal is for your total expense amount to be less than your income. If it’s not, you’ll need to tweak your expenses so that they are. This may mean cutting back or cutting out things like going out to eat or cable television. If you have a surplus, put it into your emergency fund or towards your retirement.</p>\n<p><strong>6) Keep track of spending. </strong>After you’ve created the budget for the month, keep track of every single penny you spend to ensure that you stay within your budget. Keeping track of your spending will also come in handy when you make next month’s budget. You’ll be able to review how much you spent the previous month and adjust accordingly. This is probably the hardest part of budgeting, and where most people fail. I actually ditched doing my budget by hand a few years ago and switched to using Mint because I was terribly inconsistent with keeping track of my spending.</p>\n<blockquote style=\"border:0px;background-color:#ffffff\"><p><strong><span style=\"color:#ff0000\">Track Variable Spending With the Envelope System</span> <em></em></strong></p>\n<p>One of the best old-school methods of keeping track of your variable expenses is the Envelope System.  It requires you to use cash for many of your expenses, which can be inconvenient at times, especially as more of our shopping moves online. But if it helps you to control your spending, then the inconvenience is worth it. Kate and I used the Envelope System when we were first married. Here’s how it works:</p>\n<p>Withdraw enough cash to cover your variable expenses like groceries and entertainment. Get some regular ol’ mailing envelopes and label them “Groceries” or “Entertainment” or “Gas.” Put the amount of money you’ve budgeted for each of those categories into its respective envelope. You can only use the money in the envelope when making purchases for that category. When the money runs out, you’re done spending in that category for the month.</p></blockquote>\n<p><strong>7) Review your budget every month. </strong>Each month, go over last month’s budget to see how you did. You’ll be able to see where you did well and where you can improve. After you review, repeat the whole process and make next month’s budget.</p>\n<h3><strong>My Recommendation: Automate Your Budget With Mint</strong></h3>\n<p>As I mentioned above, I stopped budgeting by hand a few years ago and started using <a href=\"https://www.mint.com/\">Mint</a> to track my budget. In my opinion, it’s the only way to go. Mint’s free online service takes all the hassle out of one of the most important steps in budgeting: tracking your spending. When you sign up for Mint, you’ll be asked to connect all your financial accounts (checking, credit cards, loans, etc.) into their system. Don’t worry. Mint uses the same 128-bit encryption and physical security that banks use. Their practices are monitored and verified by TRUSTe, VeriSign, and Hackersafe, and are supported by RSA Security. And besides, Mint is a “read only” platform. So if someone does hack into your account, they wouldn’t be able to move money.</p>\n<p><strong>Track spending automatically.</strong> Once you have your financial accounts connected to Mint, just use your debit card as you normally would. Mint automatically tracks and categorizes your spending for you. So for example, if you pick up groceries at the supermarket, Mint will automatically categorize the purchase as “Groceries.” It’s almost magical how good Mint is at categorizing things automatically.</p>\n<p><img title=\"transactions\" src=\"http://content.artofmanliness.com/uploads//2012/08/transactions.jpeg\" alt=\"\" width=\"562\" height=\"273\"></p>\n<p>The system is flexible, so if you don’t like the way it categorizes your spending, you can change it, and Mint will start organizing those transactions the way you prefer. There are times when the system gets things wrong or doesn’t know how to categorize a transaction, but correcting it isn’t difficult. Once the correction is made, Mint gets right back on track.</p>\n<p><strong>Tweak Mint’s suggested budget. </strong>After a few weeks of tracking your income and spending, Mint will create charts and graphs that are easy to understand and show you exactly where your money is going. Using this information, Mint will create a suggested budget for you that you can then tweak to meet your financial goals. What’s great about this tool is that as you adjust your budget, Mint will show you charts on how those changes will affect the amount of money you’ll have left over at the end of the month, in real time.</p>\n<p><img title=\"set-up-budget2\" src=\"http://content.artofmanliness.com/uploads//2012/08/set-up-budget21.jpeg\" alt=\"\" width=\"450\" height=\"338\"></p>\n<p><strong>Let Mint remind you if you’re getting off track. </strong>Mint will send warnings to your email or cell phone when it notices that your current spending habits have put you on a trajectory that will overshoot your allocated budget. They’ll also send you alerts when certain bills are due.</p>\n<p><img title=\"planning\" src=\"http://content.artofmanliness.com/uploads//2012/08/planning.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"450\" height=\"313\"></p>\n<p><strong>Review and adjust as needed.</strong> I log into Mint every week to see how things are going with my spending and budgeting. Mint’s easy-to-read charts make reviewing a breeze. If I need to clamp down on my budget, I make the adjustment and Mint takes care of the rest.</p>\n<h3><strong>The 50/30/20 Budget Rule of Thumb</strong></h3>\n<p>As you sit down and put pen to paper (or finger to keyboard) to figure out your budget, you may find yourself getting overwhelmed by the minutia of it all or you may be left wondering if your budget is actually realistic. Sometimes it’s helpful to have a benchmark or rule of thumb to compare your budget to see if you’re on the right track.</p>\n<p>One rule of thumb that I’ve found helpful when creating my budget was coined by Harvard bankruptcy law professor (and now Senate candidate) Elizabeth Warren. It’s called the 50/30/20 Budget Plan and calls for the following:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Limit 50% of your after tax income to <em>needs</em> like rent, utilities, food, health insurance, and car insurance. You need to be really strict about what you classify as a need. A cell phone plan with unlimited data and texting isn’t a need; cable isn’t a need; grass-fed buffalo steaks or SuperSonic burgers, while food, aren’t needs<em> </em>either.</li>\n<li>Limit 30% percent of your after tax income to <em>wants</em>. Clothes, eating out, cell phone plans, movies, subscriptions to magazines, apps, etc.</li>\n<li>Spend at least 20% of income on savings or paying down debt. If you have student loans or credit card debt, work on paying that down with at least 20% of your monthly income. Once you pay down your debt, shift to putting that money to retirement savings.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Again, this is just a rule of thumb to offer some guidance. You can adjust it if you want to be more aggressive with your debt repayment or savings. But if your spending roughly matches the 50/30/20 breakdown, you can be confident that you’re on the right track financially.</p>\n<h3><strong>Budgeting for Something Special</strong></h3>\n<p>In addition to the different kinds of fixed and variable expenses mentioned above, sometimes you want to budget for something special. Maybe you want to save up for a backpacking trip in Europe, a Saddleback briefcase, or an engagement ring for your girlfriend.</p>\n<p><iframe src=\"http://reader.googleusercontent.com/reader/embediframe?src=http://www.youtube.com/v/FWQsBnzUvkQ?version%3D3%26hl%3Den_US&amp;width=500&amp;height=375\" width=\"500\" height=\"375\"></iframe><br>\nThe awesome 1950s instructional film above reiterates some of the principles we’ve discussed, plus adds some other important principles of sticking to a budget — like fixing something to make it last longer, and buying quality instead of what’s cheapest (we’ll discuss this more in a forthcoming post). It also offers a nifty idea on how to save for something special and keep track of how long it will take you to reach a goal: keeping a graph in a little pocket notebook:</p>\n<p><img title=\"graph\" src=\"http://content.artofmanliness.com/uploads//2012/08/graph.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"500\" height=\"372\"></p>\n<p>This is the kind of thing that’s easy and fun to keep track of by hand. But <a href=\"http://www.mint.com/blog/goals/how-to-use-mints-goals-06302010/\">Mint also allows you to track your savings for a special goal</a>. First, you’ll need to create a savings account that’s just for your special savings goal. ING Direct allows you to easily create free sub-accounts for these types of goals. Once you create your special savings account, create a goal in Mint, and connect that goal to your special savings account. Mint will ask you how much money you want to save and when you need the money by. It will then spit out how much you need to save each month in order to reach it. As you save for your goal, Mint will let you know if you’re on track to meeting it by your deadline. Pretty nifty indeed!</p>\n<p><em><strong>Have any other tips for a first time budgeter?

We were pretty much like <em><a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Odd_Couple\">The Odd Couple</a>,</em> with me playing the part of the slobby Oscar Madison and my friend taking on the role of neat freak Felix Ungar, minus the annoying neuroticism.</p>\n<p>You could walk into our dorm room and instantly tell whose side was whose. My roommate’s side always looked presentable and clean: bed made, desk neat, clothes put away. My side looked like a disaster area: blankets and sheets askew, books and newspapers covering my bed, and laundry only half put away. The mess on my little twin bed sometimes got so big and unmanageable that I’d just sleep on top of all my crap, like you see those crazy people do on <em>Hoarders. </em></p>\n<p>Thankfully, my roommate was quite patient with me and kindly nudged me to start routines that would keep our place looking spic and span. I soon discovered that keeping things clean didn’t take all that much time or effort. In less than 30 minutes a day, we created a haven of order and tidiness that would make Mr. Clean (and my mom) nod with approval. And my turning over a new leaf couldn’t have come at a better time, as I started dating Kate soon after. It was nice being able to invite her over to our place without having to worry she’d be frightened to use a bathroom that looked like a giant petri dish of mold, bacteria, and other gunk.</p>\n<p>For many young men heading out on their own for the first time, maintaining a cleaning routine on their own wasn’t something they had to do at home. Sure, they might have helped with chores when asked, but they probably had their mom or dad telling them what to clean and when. But keeping your dwelling space clean and tidy is important for a variety of reasons: it’s hygienic, allows you to feel comfortable having people over (and inviting in surprise guests), gives you peace of mind, and even helps <a href=\"http://artofmanliness.com/2012/01/15/how-to-strengthen-willpower/\">conserve your supply of willpower</a>.</p>\n<p><img title=\"shutterstock_70410385(1)\" src=\"http://content.artofmanliness.com/uploads//2012/08/shutterstock_704103851.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"448\" height=\"625\"></p>\n<h3><strong>Establishing a Simple Cleaning Routine</strong></h3>\n<p>The key to keeping your place clean is to break the job up into smaller daily and weekly tasks. A lot of young men won’t clean anything for a few weeks, and then when the mess gets so huge it can no longer be ignored, have to spend a whole Saturday digging themselves out from under it. Or, the job begins to seem so enormous they can’t motivate themselves to tackle it, and let the mess grow even bigger.</p>\n<p>Below, I offer a simple suggested routine for a young man living in a dorm or apartment that will keep your place clean while only requiring a small effort every day. It goes without saying that if you’re living in an actual house, your routine will be a bit more complicated and involved. (I plan on writing about regular home maintenance later this year.)</p>\n<h3><strong>What to Do Daily</strong></h3>\n<p>Instead of letting messes pile-up, making them more of a pain in the arse to clean come Saturday morning, invest 10 minutes in the morning and 10 minutes at night in a daily cleaning routine.</p>\n<p>Here’s a suggested daily attack plan to keep your place in tip-top shape.</p>\n<p><strong>Morning</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>Make bed</li>\n<li>Spray down shower with a product that keeps it cleaner for a longer period of time, like Method Daily Shower (<a href=\"http://www.pinkyhasabrain.com/homemade-cleaning-recipes/homemade-daily-shower-spray-cleaner/\">you can also make your own</a>). Apply right after you get out.</li>\n<li>Wipe down bathroom sink and counter with a disposable Clorox wipe after you’re done getting ready</li>\n<li>Empty dishwasher (if you have one)</li>\n<li>Wipe down kitchen counters and stove with a sponge and a 409-type product after you’re done with breakfast</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>Evening</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>Wipe down kitchen counters after dinner</li>\n<li>Spot vacuum</li>\n<li>Load dishwasher (or clean dishes by hand if you’re in a dorm)</li>\n<li>Pre-bed clutter pick-up. Go through the house and put away all the clutter you find before you turn in at night.</li>\n</ul>\n<h3><strong>What to Do Weekly</strong></h3>\n<p>In addition to your morning/evening cleaning routine, do one bigger task each day of the week. Depending on the size of your place, each will take you 10-15 minutes.</p>\n<p>Here’s a suggested schedule:</p>\n<p><strong>Monday:</strong> Dust</p>\n<p><strong>Tuesday:</strong> Scrub toilets, shower, and bathroom sinks</p>\n<p><strong>Wednesday:</strong> Vacuum and mop</p>\n<p><strong>Thursday:</strong> Clean mirrors and windows</p>\n<p><strong>Friday:</strong> Clean out leftovers and wipe down inside and outside of fridge, wipe microwave inside and out, clean kitchen sink</p>\n<p><strong>Saturday:</strong> Change and wash bed sheets</p>\n<p>Adapt this schedule to fit your particular circumstances. For example, if you live in a dorm with communal bathrooms, you won’t need to scrub the toilets and shower floors. But you can still dust and vacuum.</p>\n<p>That’s it. Together, the above routines only take about 30 minutes a day. If you have roommates, you can divvy up some of the tasks and shorten the time requirement even more.</p>\n<p>Follow these routines, and your place will look great every day. All it takes is a bit of dedication and willpower to make these routines a habit, but the simplicity of this plan helps make it easier to stick with.</p>\n<p><strong><em>Any other cleaning tips for a young man heading out on his own?

Perhaps after graduation, or with the loss of a previous job.</p>\n<p><em>This is the wrong way to think of networking – and the reason why so many people think of it in a negative light.</em></p>\n<p><strong>True networking is about giving. When you do so, a natural byproduct will be others giving back to you.</strong></p>\n<h3><strong>What Business Networking Is NOT:</strong></h3>\n<ul>\n<li>Putting in effort only when you need something, such as a job or a sale. You will come across as a taker. Not one wants to be around a man who grabs everything for himself without contributing.</li>\n<li>Arriving at an event, handing out 50 business cards in 25 minutes, and then heading out the door hoping that you convert a few “prospects” into sales.</li>\n<li>Showing up to a job fair with 1000 other applicants and jockeying for position so you can pitch a recruiter for 30 seconds on why you are the man for the job.</li>\n</ul>\n<h3><strong>So What Is Networking?</strong></h3>\n<p>Business networking is the art of managing mutually beneficial relationships.</p>\n<p>It’s about giving value, and receiving value in return.</p>\n<p>It’s a long-term process. One that a man cultivates over an entire career and protects with his good name.</p>\n<p>Professional networking, in its essence, boils down to two things:</p>\n<ol>\n<li><strong>Building Awareness</strong><strong></strong></li>\n<li><strong>Being Referable</strong></li>\n</ol>\n<h3><strong>Part 1: Awareness – The Importance of Being Visible</strong></h3>\n<p>My family uses two vehicles, a truck (mine) and a minivan (my wife’s). Every year I spend a sizeable amount of money on maintenance with a mechanic 30 miles away. There is also a great mechanic (from what I hear) who runs a shop one mile from my house. So why do I drive out of my way for this common service?</p>\n<p>It boils down to awareness. In 2007, when I  needed to make a decision about car repair, I was only aware of the mechanic whose shop was across from my son’s daycare, which just happened to be around 30 miles from home in Shawano, WI. I walked in, was impressed with the owner’s knowledge, and have been happy with his work ever since.</p>\n<p>The point is, we generally hire the best people we can find within our network. We rarely hold out for the perfect job candidate, as businesses have to, well, do business.</p>\n<p>So how do you get out in front of the person you need to be seen by?</p>\n<p><strong>Awareness Tip #1: Engage Your Circle of Influence</strong></p>\n<p>Your personal network starts with the people you already know. For most of us that includes friends, families, co-workers past and present, and people we went to school with.</p>\n<p>Stay in touch with all of them and let everyone know what you are looking for – whether it’s a service need or a new career. You never know when someone is going to turn from a passing acquaintance into a useful contact. The internet has made keeping up on old acquaintances much easier. Now you have no excuse. Keep an eye on where all your old friends and classmates have moved to and what they’re up to. Lightly engage with them and sincerely ask how their careers and lives are developing. Any deep relationship always starts with a shallow beginning.</p>\n<p>Most people are passive about connecting with old friends or classmates, so you’ll need to be the proactive one. Send real holiday and birthday cards and be sure to always send a nice note, or at least an email, for events like marriages, children, new jobs, etc.  People really do remember these things.</p>\n<p>You probably won’t see much immediate reward for your diligence, but you’ll be remembered more clearly than all the other old friends, relations, co-workers, and so on that haven’t bothered to send the occasional greeting card or online message.</p>\n<p>What this means is that you’ll have the hard work already done when you need assistance from one of those friends. It’ll also encourage them to come to you for favors, giving you a chance to increase your likeability as well as your presence in their life.</p>\n<p><strong>Awareness Tip #2: Talk to Strangers</strong></p>\n<p><img title=\"shakinghands\" src=\"http://content.artofmanliness.com/uploads//2012/08/shakinghands.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"333\" height=\"398\"></p>\n<p>You never know where you’re going to make a professional connection.</p>\n<p>Increase your chances of doing so by being social when you’re out in public. Talk to the person next to you at the hotel bar. Ask your local barista how they’re doing. Circulate at parties and introduce yourself to new people, rather than clustering with the guests you already know.</p>\n<p>The art of conversation is a forgotten skill, and it seems like most young men are content with putting their heads down and texting or checking their Twitter feed.</p>\n<p>Break yourself of this habit.</p>\n<p>Now I admit – talking to new people takes a bit of courage. Cultivate it. Practice approaching strangers, offering your hand, and simply saying, “Hi there! I don’t think we’ve met. My name’s ____.”</p>\n<p>This basic skill will work everywhere from a neighborhood tavern to a black tie gala. Be prepared to follow it up with simple, neutral questions like, “What brings you here?” Not everyone is good at talking to strangers, and you can expect to be the one guiding the conversation at first.</p>\n<p>From time to time it won’t come off right. You’ll get someone who’s shy, or snobby, or just distracted, and the conversation will end almost as soon as it begins. But the best thing about introducing yourself (and being good at doing so) is that you can move right on to the next person and do it again.</p>\n<p>Master this skill in today’s day and age and you’ll be way ahead of most young men.</p>\n<p><strong>Awareness Tip #3: Follow Up</strong></p>\n<p>Meeting people is great. But to actually network you have to get them to connect with you after that first meeting, otherwise you’re just a fading memory (if that).</p>\n<p>The best ways to follow up are:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Give out accurate contact information.</li>\n<li>Give a reason for the other person to follow up with you.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>For example: Business cards with basic contact info are a dime a dozen at conferences. But if you hand a person a card with a handwritten invitation, “Send me an e-mail and I’ll see if I know anyone with an opening in your field,” etc., you’re much more likely to actually get that e-mail.</p>\n<p>Business cards are still the most convenient way to give someone your contact info (at least in person), but smartphones have made it possible to send an e-mail, Facebook or LinkedIn invite, or other electronic contact right then and there. Make use of all the available options. Someone looking for a job (or to hire someone) is going to get more use out of your LinkedIn page, while a potential social contact will do better with your phone number and e-mail address. Also, be aware of your industry standards. If you’re in San Francisco looking for a tech job, you’ll want to be using the latest connection apps. If you’re looking for construction management work in St Louis, however, stick with business cards.</p>\n<p>When someone gives you this sort of information, it’s worth your while to do exactly what you’d want them to. Follow up on it the next day with a short e-mail or phone call.</p>\n<p>Some people are wary of giving too much contact information out publicly, which is a valid concern in this day and age. If you’re worried about strangers having your information, it’s worth getting a second phone line or email address that you can have printed on your business cards. That way you’re never giving out the information you use with friends and families.</p>\n<p>A small trick I employ is the use of a professional name (Antonio) with all my business associates and my nickname (Tony) with friends and family. This small separation allows me to quickly filter messages and phone calls.</p>\n<p><strong>Awareness Tip #4: Maintain Your Online Presence</strong></p>\n<p><img title=\"skype\" src=\"http://content.artofmanliness.com/uploads//2012/08/skype.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"500\" height=\"381\"></p>\n<p>Brett and Kate covered <a title=\"Heading Out on Your Own — Day 9: Managing Your Online Reputation\" href=\"http://artofmanliness.com/2012/08/09/manage-your-online-reputation/\">the subject of managing your online reputation</a> very well last week, but allow me to touch on the topic again today to discuss how it relates to networking.</p>\n<p>To begin, let me be clear here – not all of us need to be using Facebook, LinkedIn, or any of the other social networks (and most of us could do well by not being on them every single day).</p>\n<p>Some professions just don’t need online networking, and some professionals selectively choose to remain offline in order to focus on business practices that worked for them well before the invention of the internet.</p>\n<p>That said, the first thing many of us do before contacting a stranger is search their name online to see who they are and brush up on the relevant personal details, so it can pay to create a profile on social networking sites.</p>\n<p>There are literally hundreds of social platforms out there. I’ll talk about four.</p>\n<p><strong>LinkedIn</strong> – This is by far the social networking platform most men should be on. It’s not only a place to post your resume and work experience, but also a rich source of news, business advice, and a great place to meet people before you attend networking events. Most of all, I want to stress that this is the right place for networkers because everyone on the platform understands that we’re here to do business. It’s not to socialize or read up on gossip, which can’t be said for the others.  For more information, <a title=\"linkedin profile better improve\" href=\"http://www.realmenrealstyle.com/linkedin-profile-presentation/\">click here for my 6 tips on improving your LinkedIn profile</a>.</p>\n<p><strong>Facebook</strong> – If you have a personal profile, keep it private and never post anything you wouldn’t want a prospective boss to see. If you’re starting your own business or promoting a product, Facebook offers a huge upside as it makes creating a business page simple.</p>\n<p><strong>Google+</strong> – This newer network is much smaller than Facebook. I put it on this list because a profile on Google+ will give you a leg up in Google search results. If you’re a young artist looking to show the world your portfolio, making it easily found on Google’s preferred social network is a smart move.</p>\n<p><strong>Twitter</strong> – The network of instant information, these profiles pop up high in the search results but are best left for those looking to break into fields that actually use it. Public relations, marketing, and other media type professions might take note if you show a mastery of this tool.</p>\n<p><strong>Awareness Tip #5: Accept Offline Invitations</strong></p>\n<p><em>Get out there and physically meet people.</em></p>\n<p>If a professional contact wants to have lunch and you can spare the time, do it. If a friend has a poetry reading at the local coffee shop, go support her with an open mind. Stop by parties for at least a little while. And so on.</p>\n<p><em>However strong your online networking skills are, the best contacts are still made face-to-face.</em></p>\n<p>Large public gatherings expose you to people who you would never find a “shared interest” with using online profiles, but who just might have opportunities for you all the same. Networking is unpredictable, and you never know who’s going to turn out to be a stroke of blind luck.</p>\n<h3><strong>Part 2: Be Referable – The Importance of Others Being Able To Pass You Along</strong></h3>\n<p>The power of networking isn’t that you’ll actually be able to pitch yourself to a prospective employer. No, the real power is that one of your connections will do it for you. Why?</p>\n<p>Because referable men are valuable men. They have a definable skill set needed by certain groups, businesses, and individuals.  An F-18 technician, a .NET programmer, a distance swimming coach — each of these professionals offers value and is referable. What they offer to the marketplace is clear.</p>\n<p>Companies pay recruiters large sums to help find them the right people. If someone in your network refers you to the perfect job opening, they have delivered value to two people in their network – you, of course, but also the employer.</p>\n<p>But how do you become someone who is referable?</p>\n<p><strong>Referable Tip #1: Be Memorable</strong></p>\n<p>The most important tip to being referable is to be memorable. If a person doesn’t remember what you do or how you can help others in their network, they can’t refer you to their friends, EVEN if they want to.</p>\n<p>Have a tight 30-second elevator pitch about who you are and what you can offer. Also, if time permits, have an example success story to share. People remember stories, not facts and figures.</p>\n<p>Example:</p>\n<blockquote><p>Stranger: “So Antonio, what do you do?”</p>\n<p>Me: “Well you know how most men dress poorly?”</p>\n<p>Stranger: “Yeah, sure.”</p>\n<p>Me: “Well I run a company that teaches men how to dress better so they can succeed in business. In fact, I just helped a young man last week from Iowa rebuild his wardrobe. He went through a round of five interviews over five days with a big consulting company in Chicago and never once had to worry about his clothing. He got the job. I like to think, in part, because he was able to focus in on what’s important and not worry about looking like a kid from the cornfields.”</p></blockquote>\n<p>OK – so at this point I’ve spoken for 30 seconds.</p>\n<p>Yet I’ve created a powerful and memorable image of who I am and what I do.</p>\n<p>The man I’m speaking with doesn’t need any clothing or help dressing sharp. However, 30 minutes later he introduces me to a colleague to whom he has already repeated my story. The man I’m introduced to admits he needs to build a wardrobe – the perfect prospective client.</p>\n<p>Be memorable, and when people find someone who needs your services they will make the introduction.</p>\n<p><strong>Referable Tip #2: Dress to Impress</strong></p>\n<p>Your very first impression at any face-to-face meeting is visual. Everything else comes after that.</p>\n<p>Being well-dressed makes you seem less threatening when you approach strangers, more influential when people are evaluating your usefulness as a contact, and more attractive to potential friends or romantic interests.</p>\n<p>You certainly don’t have to go through life in a business suit, and in fact you should be actively avoiding business wear when you attend social events (unless it’s called for). But upgrading from jeans and a t-shirt to slacks and a dress shirt with a sports jacket for your default “around town” outfit can make a huge difference in your networking.</p>\n<p>We’ve written quite a bit about dressing sharp:  <a href=\"http://artofmanliness.com/category/dress-grooming/\">Click here to read through AOM’s collection of style articles</a> or <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/user/RealMenRealStyle\">click here to watch over 250 videos on men’s style</a>.</p>\n<p><strong>Referable Tip #3: Offer Sincere Compliments</strong></p>\n<p>If you admire something about someone, there’s no shame in telling them. It creates a feeling of goodwill, and people want to be around people who make them feel good.</p>\n<p>The best compliments are based off a little research or close observation. Perhaps the gentleman you’re speaking with is a newly hired teacher at a local junior college – congratulate him on the position and ask about the challenges he’s facing as a new faculty member. Perhaps the woman to your left mentioned her book earlier in the night – point out that you admire the commitment writers have, and ask her to talk about the experience of being an author.</p>\n<p>Never lay a compliment on too thick or expand beyond a simple one-sentence compliment. Use them to break the ice and then lead into a natural conversation.</p>\n<p>At the end of the evening, what you talked about may be forgotten. The way you made others feel, though, is remembered.</p>\n<p><strong>Referable Tip #4: Listen &amp; Show Interest</strong></p>\n<p>Listen to what the people you meet are saying instead of just waiting for your turn to speak.</p>\n<p>Ask intelligent questions and show a genuine interest in the conversation. This means that you stop checking your smartphone every three minutes to see if you received an email or text – it really is a sign of disrespect. Personally, I turn my phone completely off at networking events to avoid temptation.</p>\n<p>When you’re first meeting someone you want to use the words “I” and “me” sparingly. You’ll have to use them a few times, obviously (“My name is…” etc.), but limit yourself. Resist the urge to identify with the other person’s story by relating it to your life.</p>\n<p>Instead, ask easy questions about the other person. If it’s a business event, “What do you do?” is always reliable, as is, “How long have you lived in town?” It may take a few of these until you hit on the one that makes them expand beyond one-sentence answers, so always have a couple ready to go in any conversation.</p>\n<p><strong>Referable Tip #5: Be of Specific Use</strong></p>\n<p>The funny thing is that this last tip is the real reason why a person should hire or partner with you.</p>\n<p>Why is it last on the list, then? In most networking situations you’re not going to speak with the hiring manager right off.</p>\n<p>Instead, you’ll more likely find yourself in a conversation with one of their sales reps or other associates. If you start the conversation with a 15-minutes one-sided discussion about how you can code in six programming languages you’re going to get the eyes-glossed-over look two minutes into the conversation.</p>\n<p>Really, they don’t care about the coding. And that’s the problem. When networking, we try to ram our usefulness down other people’s throats.</p>\n<p>Rather than trying to impress, look to be of use.  <strong>Ask about them and learn about their issues, then see if you can provide value from your wide range of skillsets.</strong></p>\n<p>Imagine if this same sales rep mentioned how a bug in their system continuously caused him and his team to show up unprepared to a client’s office. Even though you haven’t done this type of work for a year, you might be able to offer a solution they hadn’t considered, and then 15 minutes later that same sales rep is introducing you to the hiring manager who was in another room.</p>\n<p><strong>Be a useful man and opportunity will seek you out.</strong></p>\n<h3><strong>Immediate Action – What Can You Do Today?</strong></h3>\n<p><em>The best time to plant a tree is twenty years ago. The second best time is now.</em></p>\n<p>I can’t remember where I read this, but it is the best advice I can give a young man who is just starting and perhaps feels behind.</p>\n<p><strong>The simple answer is (and there is no way to shortcut this): you have to earn people’s trust.</strong> That’s how relationships have been, and will always be, built.</p>\n<p>So start building your network today, right now. Ask for help, offer value, and maintain the relationships.</p>\n<p>And remember, the best networkers build strong relationships before they ever need them.</p>\n<p>__________________________</p>\n<p><em>Written by:</em><br>\n<em>Antonio Centeno, Founder, Real Men Real Style</em><br>\n<em><a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/user/RealMenRealStyle\">Click here to watch my men’s style videos</a></em></p>\n<p>Related posts:<ol>\n<li><a href=\"http://artofmanliness.com/2009/05/05/network-like-a-man/\" rel=\"bookmark\" title=\"Network Like a Man\">Network Like a Man</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"http://artofmanliness.com/2012/08/11/understanding-credit/\" rel=\"bookmark\" title=\"Heading Out on Your Own — Day 11: Understand Credit\">Heading Out on Your Own — Day 11: Understand Credit</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"http://artofmanliness.com/2012/08/06/how-to-ace-a-job-interview/\" rel=\"bookmark\" title=\"Heading Out on Your Own — Day 6: How to Ace a Job Interview\">Heading Out on Your Own — Day 6: How to Ace a Job Interview</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"http://artofmanliness.com/2012/08/01/heading-out-on-your-own-day-1-develop-a-self-reliant-mentality/\" rel=\"bookmark\" title=\"Heading Out on Your Own — Day 1: Develop a Self-Reliant Mentality\">Heading Out on Your Own — Day 1: Develop a Self-Reliant Mentality</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"http://artofmanliness.com/2012/08/08/rules-for-roommates/\" rel=\"bookmark\" title=\"Heading Out on Your Own — Day 8: Living With Roommates\">Heading Out on Your Own — Day 8: Living With Roommates</a></li>\n</ol></p><p><iframe src=\"http://feedads.g.doubleclick.net/~ah/f/f3iv4dtffn7nla1icg3h2et32g/300/250?ca=1&amp;fh=280#http%3A%2F%2Fartofmanliness.com%2F2012%2F08%2F13%2Fnetworking-young-man%2F\" width=\"100%\" height=\"280\" frameborder=\"0\" scrolling=\"no\" marginwidth=\"0\" marginheight=\"0\"></iframe></p><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/TheArtOfManliness/~4/5IxeCUH2zeQ\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\">"

I can still remember my first (and only!) accident. It happened just a few weeks after I turned 16. Rear-ended a guy. My small, but noble Isuzu Hombre was no match for the other guy’s giant Ford F-150. The front end of my comparatively small pick-up was swallowed underneath the rear bumper of the truck I hit. While he had just a few dings, my vehicle was totaled.</p>\n<p>I remember getting out of my truck feeling sort of shell-shocked. I made sure the other person was okay and was relieved to find out that I hadn’t maimed or injured anyone.  By then, my friends who had been driving behind me arrived at the scene of the crash. They tried to console me, but all I did was pace back and forth, pointing at my car and yelling “MY CAR IS SCREWED!” over and over again like a crazy man. Not my finest moment. My friends thought it was the funniest thing in the world, however, and still rib me about it.</p>\n<p>I had no clue what I was supposed to do in a car accident, but I knew someone who did: dear old Mom. I called my mom on my <a href=\"http://spravodaj.madaj.net/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/motorola-microtac.jpg\">1999 Motorola MicroTac</a> (eat your heart out Zach Morris), and she was on the scene in no time flat, ready to basically take care of things for me.</p>\n<p>But what would have happened if I had gotten in the accident when I was a few years older and hundreds of miles away from home at college? Would I have known how to handle the situation correctly without Mom and Dad? Probably not.</p>\n<p>To avoid pulling a Brett and going crazy when you get in an accident, read this article and prepare yourself.</p>\n<p><em>Note: This advice applies to accidents when it is obvious you are not seriously injured. If you are, call 911 immediately, or if you cannot, hope that someone else will, and wait for the ambulance to arrive.</em></p>\n<p><img title=\"carwreck\" src=\"http://content.artofmanliness.com/uploads//2012/08/carwreck.jpg\" alt=\"\"></p>\n<p><strong>Stay calm.</strong> Now is not the time to lose your cool. Keep your wits about yourself.</p>\n<p><strong>Safety is your top priority. </strong>Your first priority is to maintain the safety of everyone involved in the accident and to take actions to prevent more smash-ups and injuries. If the accident is minor and the cars are still functioning, move them off or to the side of the road.</p>\n<p>If the cars aren’t going anywhere without a tow truck, turn on your  hazard lights, exit the vehicle when it’s safe to do so, and walk to the side of the road and out of traffic. Ideally, you should have a warning triangle or flares in your <a href=\"http://artofmanliness.com/2009/12/17/13-things-a-man-should-keep-in-his-car/\">car’s emergency kit.</a> Place those on the road to give other drivers a heads up on the accident. You don’t want another car plowing into your pile-up.</p>\n<p><strong>Check for injuries. </strong>Ask everyone who was in the car with you if they’re okay. Then check on the driver and passengers of the other car. Call 911 for an ambulance if needed.</p>\n<p><strong>Call the police.</strong> After an accident, the other person involved might suggest not calling the police and settling things between just the two of you. Ignore him and call the police, even if it’s just a minor fender bender. Here’s why:</p>\n<p style=\"padding-left:30px\"><strong>By law, you may be required to call the police.</strong> In most states, you’re only required to call the authorities after a car accident if someone has been injured, the accident is blocking traffic, or property damage (including cars) is above a certain monetary amount. Failure to comply with the law could result in an additional fine, so don’t try to judge for yourself if those requirements have been met. Let the police dispatcher decide that. After you’ve described the accident to the dispatch, they may or may not decide to send officers to the scene. If they don’t, they’ll usually tell you to file an accident report at a station or online.</p>\n<p style=\"padding-left:30px\"><strong>A police report can help establish liability. </strong>The insurance companies of the respective drivers will work together to determine fault. One of the most credible documents the insurers will use in doing so is an official police report. Without a report, figuring out liability becomes an issue of he said/she said. If you were the one hit, you definitely want a police report. I know a few instances where people didn’t call the police after an accident, and ultimately regretted not doing so. Those involved exchanged information, but when the drivers who were hit called the offending drivers’ insurance companies to make a claim, the offending drivers denied the whole thing and accused the victim drivers of insurance fraud. That wouldn’t have happened with a police report.</p>\n<p style=\"padding-left:30px\">Even if you are responsible for the accident, you should still call the police. It could be the case that the driver you hit contributed to the accident and shares responsibility, or there may have been factors beyond your control that reduce your responsibility. If you don’t want to be held completely liable for the accident and have your insurance rates jacked up, get that information in an official police report.</p>\n<p style=\"padding-left:30px\">Even if the police don’t come, file a report as soon as you can. At least you’ll have your side of the story on record. That can help in the insurance claim.</p>\n<p style=\"padding-left:30px\"><strong>A police report can protect you from fraud. </strong>You come to a red light and roll to a stop behind a car. The light turns green and as the car in front of you begins driving forward, so do you. All of sudden, the car in front of you immediately stops, causing you to rear-end the other driver. While it’s certainly possible the driver in front of you had a good reason to stop, it’s also possible that he’s a fraudster pulling the old “start and stop” auto-insurance scam on you.</p>\n<p style=\"padding-left:30px\">Individuals who stage accidents in order to fraudulently collect insurance money will often suggest not calling the police and just exchanging information. But even if the accident is minor, call the police. Officers are trained at detecting staged accidents. Having them at the scene can help expose the fraud so you’re not held liable for what happened.</p>\n<p style=\"padding-left:30px\"><strong>Having the police on the scene can keep everyone calm and collected. </strong>Emotions can run high at an accident. Having the police there to act as an impartial referee can ensure that things don’t get too heated.</p>\n<p>Bottom line: call the police no matter what. If the accident is a minor one, don’t call 911, just call the police directly (you might want to program this number into your phone).</p>\n<p>Before the officer leaves, get his name and badge number</p>\n<p><strong>Exchange information with the other driver. </strong>You’ll want to exchange the following information with the other driver:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Name</li>\n<li>Address</li>\n<li>Telephone number</li>\n<li>Email</li>\n<li>Driver’s license number</li>\n<li>Insurance company</li>\n<li>Policy number</li>\n</ul>\n<p>You don’t need a Social Security Number in order to file a police report or claim. If a driver or even the police ask for it, politely, but firmly say, “You don’t need that information in order to file a claim/report.”</p>\n<p>You should always have a pen and notebook in your car, so you can write down the details we mention above and below. Alternatively, many insurance companies now offer extremely useful apps that not only allow you to record the details of the accident, but also have features which help you “draw” the scene of the accident, take photos, collect witness observations, jot down notes, and file a claim.</p>\n<p><strong>Write down the information about the car accident. </strong>After you’ve exchanged information with the other driver, write down the following information about the accident itself:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Time</li>\n<li>Location of accident (It also doesn’t hurt to draw a rough sketch of how you think the accident went down)</li>\n<li>Description of other car, including: make, model, year, color, license plate number, and any visible damage</li>\n<li>Description of individuals involved in accident, including passengers</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>Take plenty of pictures.</strong> Use the camera on your cellphone to document the vehicle damage. The more pictures the better. Keep in mind that you want your photos to show the overall context of the accident so that you can make your case to a claims adjuster. Take pictures from a distance to show the accident in its entirety, as well as pictures up close to show property damage. If there are any skid marks, take pictures of those too. If you think you were responsible for the accident, take pictures of the car you hit from the rear, front, and sides. That way, if the driver accuses you of causing damage to his car that existed prior to the accident, you’ll be able to prove he’s lying.</p>\n<p><strong>Get witness information. </strong>If there are witnesses, try to get their information including their name, address, and phone number. Their observations can help your case in assigning liability.</p>\n<p><strong>Don’t admit fault or assign blame. </strong>Even if it’s obvious whose fault the accident was, don’t ever admit fault or assign blame. That’s for the police and insurance companies to figure out. While it may pain your inner-gentleman (<a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?feature=player_embedded&amp;v=fTvj18nHD4s\">and Louis C.K.</a>) to do so, don’t say “I’m sorry.” It’s an admission of fault. As soon as you exchange information with the driver and find out he or she is okay, zip your lip and keep discussion to a minimum. You don’t want to say anything that could be used against you during the insurance claims process or police report. The only people you want to talk to about the accident are the police and your insurance company.</p>\n<p><strong>Call your insurance company. </strong>Regardless of fault, call <em>your</em> insurance company and report the accident as soon as possible. If it is your fault, your policy likely requires that you do so. Calling your insurer to report the accident also ensures you get your side of the story on record before the other driver files a claim. That can put you at an advantage in reducing the amount the other driver claims.</p>\n<p>If the accident is the other driver’s fault, you have the option to call their insurance company and file a claim on your own without even letting your own company know about the accident. But it’s probably better that your insurance company files the claim on your behalf. The other driver’s insurer is going to do whatever it can to give you the least amount of money. Instead of trying to fight a giant corporation for the money you deserve, let another giant corporation (your insurance company) do the fighting for you.</p>\n<p>When you call the insurance company, give them your information, when and where the accident occurred, and the insurance information of the other driver. If the other driver didn’t have insurance, give the driver’s name and address. Let the agent know that a police report has been filed and that you took pictures.</p>\n<p>Your insurance company will send out an adjuster to look at your car and give you an estimate on the damage. The other driver’s company will also send out their own adjuster to get their own estimate. The two insurance companies will duke it out on what amount you’ll get or what insurance will pay, depending on who’s at fault.</p>\n<p>After you’ve called the insurance company, everything else sort of takes care of itself. You’ll likely be told what shop to take your car to. If you need a car while yours is getting repaired, the insurance company will pay for it. Barring any injuries, your life will likely go back to normal soon enough.</p>\n<h3><strong>What Should I Do If I Hit a Parked Car?</strong></h3>\n<p>You’re driving in the parking lot and in a moment of carelessness you run into an unattended parked car. While it may be tempting to just hightail it out of there and let no one be the wiser, you should try to find the owner or at least leave a note for two very good reasons. First, it’s just the right thing to do. You made a mistake that damaged someone’s property, so you should shoulder the responsibility of getting the car repaired.</p>\n<p>Second, you’re required by law to find the owner or at least leave a note. Hitting an unattended parked car and leaving the scene without contacting the owner or leaving a note with your information constitutes a hit and run violation. If you were tracked down somehow (which gets easier and easier, especially with parking lot cameras and witnesses with smartphones), you’d likely face a heavy fine for leaving the scene of an accident on top of having to pay for the damages you caused when you hit the car.</p>\n<p>So what’s the protocol if you a hit an unattended parked car?</p>\n<p>First, get out and assess the damage. If you totally smashed the car, you should probably go ahead and call the police. But if it’s just a fender bender or busted taillight, there’s no need to call the cops.  With your cellphone camera, take lots of pictures of the front, sides, and rear of the car you hit. You don’t want the owner trying to milk you and your insurance company for damages you didn’t cause.</p>\n<p>After you’ve taken pictures and if it’s possible, find the owner and give him your information, including your name, phone number, insurance company, and policy number. If you can’t find the owner, leave a note on the windshield of the car with the same information. The vehicle’s owner may or may not call you.  They’ll likely just call your insurance company to file a claim.

When it comes to understanding personal finance, this component looms large. For some it is a dirty word, to be avoided at all costs. For others, it is an intoxicating license, an opportunity to reach for a lifestyle well beyond their means.</p>\n<p>In truth, credit can be extremely helpful or harmful depending on how it’s used. In many ways, credit is more of a tool than anything else – simply a means of achieving some desired outcome. In the hands of an uneducated, unskilled, and inexperienced person, a fire, a table saw, or a gun can cause havoc and harm. But in the hands of a responsible and educated individual, they can be immensely useful. So it is with credit.</p>\n<p>A bad use of credit would be buying a huge flatscreen television with a credit card; you’ll receive little return on the interest you’ll pay on that balance. A good use of credit would be taking out loans to get an education, or for a car to get you to and from a job; these things put you in debt in the short-term, but will improve your financial prospects in the long-term.</p>\n<p>When you need to use credit in a positive way, your ability to do so will be based on the credit history and score you have been establishing for years, starting when you first headed out on your own.</p>\n<p><strong>What Is Credit?</strong></p>\n<p>As the dictionary defines it, credit is: “<a href=\"https://www.google.com/search?q=what+is+credit&amp;sugexp=chrome,mod=17&amp;sourceid=chrome&amp;ie=UTF-8#hl=en&amp;q=credit&amp;tbs=dfn:1&amp;tbo=u&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=x6cmUIKHEMS2rQGYq4HwCg&amp;ved=0CIMBEJEO&amp;bav=on.2,or.r_gc.r_pw.r_cp.r_qf.&amp;fp=bd0b9b0e2ef66982&amp;biw=1418&amp;bih=705\">The ability to obtain goods or services before payment, based on the trust that payment will be made in the future</a>.” Student loans, car loans, home mortgages, and credit cards are all types of consumer credit instruments — you’re getting money <em>now</em> to pay for something you otherwise couldn’t afford, based on the lender trusting that you’ll pay them back <em>later</em>.</p>\n<p>Sometimes credit is completely free, but it usually comes at a price. Most banks and institutions will charge <em>interest</em> on the money they lend you (aka, the principle) in exchange for giving you the funds, along with the opportunity to pay it back slowly over an extended period of time.</p>\n<p>Different types of credit have different interest rates. Student loans often have lower interest rates than other types because many of them are guaranteed by the U.S. government. Even if you can’t pay them back, the lender will still get their money from the government. Credit cards, on the other hand, often have the highest interest rates among the various types of credit because: 1) there’s a higher risk that the credit card lender won’t get repaid and 2) it’s more expensive to manage credit card debt (at least that’s what the credit card companies say).</p>\n<p>Even among the same kinds of loans, you’ll find different interest rates. That’s because people have varying degrees of “creditworthiness”. You’ll often hear banks refer to people as having “good credit,” bad credit,” or “no credit.” People with good credit have a reputation for being a responsible borrower. They pay their bills on time and manage the credit available to them responsibly. People with good credit not only have access to more money, they also get lower interest rates on their loans.</p>\n<p>People with bad credit have a reputation for not paying their bills on time or even not paying them at all. Banks and other businesses are less willing to extend credit to these individuals. Even if they’re able to get a loan, a person with bad credit will be charged a higher interest rate.</p>\n<p>Folks with no credit simply don’t have a history of using credit, so they’re kind of a wild card. They might be good with credit, or they might not. When banks loan money to people in this situation, they’ll usually start off charging a higher interest rate, but they’ll be willing to bring it down as the debtor demonstrates they can repay the balance owed on a consistent basis.</p>\n<p><strong>How Do Banks Know If You’re Creditworthy?</strong></p>\n<p>So how do banks or credit card companies know whether you have good credit, bad credit, or no credit? When you apply for a loan, the person reviewing the application probably doesn’t know you from Adam. How can they possibly discern whether or not they can trust you to pay them back?</p>\n<p>Put on your tin foil hat folks, because the answer is that there are three big credit agencies keeping track of how you use credit — from how much you borrow to how often you are late on payments.</p>\n<p>You’ve probably seen the commercials on TV about how to get your hands on a <em>free credit report</em>. That’s the record those Big Brother-like agencies have on you. These commercials will also typically mention something called a <em>credit score</em>. That’s the number that banks use to indicate whether you’re a trustworthy borrower or not.</p>\n<p>Many young people just getting their feet wet in the world of credit often confuse credit reports with credit scores, and vice versa. It’s an easy mistake to make, but one that can be corrected with a quick primer on the difference between the two.</p>\n<p><strong>What’s a Credit Report?</strong></p>\n<p>Credit reports explain what you do with your credit. They state when and where you applied for credit, whom you borrowed money from, and whom you still owe. Your credit report also tells if you’ve paid off a debt and if you make monthly payments on time.</p>\n<p>Federal law mandates that all three major credit reporting agencies must each give you a free credit report each year. So, when those TV commercials talk about getting a free credit report, the above information is what they’re offering.</p>\n<p>But, getting your free credit report from a heavily-advertised site like FreeCreditReport.com or FreeCreditScore.com isn’t a good idea. In return for getting a free credit report and score, you have to enroll in their monthly credit-monitoring service for $15 a month. If you cancel within seven days, the report and score are indeed free, but if not, your subscription to their service will begin. The pain is that you have to call to cancel — you can’t do it online — and you might forget (that’s what they’re counting on).</p>\n<p>Instead, get your free credit report with no strings attached from <a href=\"https://www.annualcreditreport.com/cra/index.jsp\">AnnualCreditReport.com</a>. This site offers you a truly free report from each of the three credit agencies. You can get them all at once, but I would recommend staggering them throughout the year so you can keep more regular tabs on your credit score.</p>\n<p><strong>Why You Need to Request Your Credit Report Every Year</strong></p>\n<p>There are a couple of reasons why you should request a free credit report each year. First, it allows you to check for and correct mistakes that have crept into your report. You don’t want those mistakes to affect whether you get a higher or lower interest rate, or whether a bank will approve a loan for you at all. When you spot a mistake, you can start taking actions to clean it up.</p>\n<p>The second big reason you want to request a credit report every year is to protect yourself from identity theft. With the right information, a con-artist can apply for a wallet full of credit cards in your name without you knowing it. Then you start getting calls out of the blue from collection agencies asking you to pay up on purchases you never made. A yearly credit report lets you check to see if anybody is fraudulently using your name to apply for credit cards or loans without your knowledge and take action if needed.</p>\n<p><strong>What’s a Credit Score?</strong></p>\n<p>Your credit score is determined by the information in your credit report. Credit scores are used by companies and banks to evaluate the potential risk posed by lending money to individual consumers. Your credit score determines if you qualify for a loan, what your loan’s interest rate will be, and what your credit limit is. It’s basically your trustworthiness score for lenders.</p>\n<p>The company that came up with the idea of a credit score was the Fair Isaac Corporation. That’s why you’ve probably heard credit scores referred to as a FICO score. Because each of the three credit agencies collect slightly different information about you, you’ll have three different credit scores, although it’s possible for all of them to be the same.</p>\n<p>Credit scores range from 500 to 850. If you have a FICO score of 500, you’re going to have a hard time getting a loan. Even if you manage to get one, the interest rate on it will be high. With any score above 720, you’ll receive the best rates available. Whenever you apply for a credit card or car loan, banks and credit card companies will check your credit score to determine whether to lend you money or extend the credit card to you in the first place. If they do decide to extend you credit, they’ll then use your credit score to determine the interest rate they’ll charge you for borrowing money.</p>\n<p>Unlike credit reports, which are free, credit scores cost money to view. They cost about $15 to access, and you’re given the offer to purchase your credit score after you get a credit report. <a href=\"http://www.bankrate.com/calculators/credit-score-fico-calculator.aspx/\">Bankrate, however, offers a free FICO score estimator</a>. The estimator asks you 10 questions about your loans and credit card balances and then spits out an estimate of your credit score. While not 100% accurate, you’ll at least have an idea of where your score is at and make adjustments in order to improve it.</p>\n<p><strong>How Your Credit Score is Determined</strong></p>\n<p>Because your credit score can possibly make or break some important financial and lifestyle decisions, it’s important to understand how the credit agencies determine your score so you can take actions to ensure it’s the best it can be.</p>\n<p>When coming up with your FICO score, credit reporting companies look at several factors, including:</p>\n<p><strong>Payment record. </strong>35% of your score depends on your ability to pay your bills on time. Payments that are more than 90 days late will hurt more than a payment that’s just 30 days late. Also, recent late payments hurt more than older ones. A single late payment won’t kill your score, so don’t panic that you’ll never be creditworthy because you missed a payment. Just pay the bill and try not to let it happen again.</p>\n<p><strong>Amount borrowed relative to available credit. </strong>This factor accounts for 30% of your score. The credit companies want to know if you’re borrowing to the max. If you have $10,000 of available credit, and you consistently run a balance of $9,999, that’s a red flag that you’re not very prudent about your debt. However, if you usually have a balance of $200 of outstanding debt, that’s a sign you’re more responsible with credit. To improve your score, try to keep your debt to about 10% or less of your available credit.</p>\n<p><strong>Length of credit history.</strong> This is 15% of your score. The longer you have successfully borrowed money and paid it back, the less risk you are to a lender. If you pay off a credit card, it’s good to keep it open, even if you never use it. When you close it, you lose that credit history, which could in turn affect your score.</p>\n<p><strong>“Hard” Credit Pulls.</strong> This is 10% of your credit score. A pull is a type of inquiry into your credit. Hard credit inquiries are made by lenders for the purpose of extending you credit. These will lower your score because having multiple hard inquiries is a signal that you’re looking for loans and are possibly a poor credit risk. So, when the cashier asks if you want to sign-up for a store credit card to get a 10% discount, tell them “no thanks” in order to avoid the hard credit pull.</p>\n<p>If you’re shopping around for a car loan or mortgage, lenders will have to pull your credit score every time you ask for a quote. Don’t worry about those types of pulls hurting your score. Similar inquiries made within a two-week period won’t ding your score.</p>\n<p><strong>Types of debt.</strong> This is the final 10% of your score. It’s best to have a mix of car, home, student loans, and little to no credit card debt. If you’re up to your eyeballs in credit card debt, you’ll be seen as bigger risk.</p>\n<p><strong>Other factors. </strong>In addition to your FICO score, lenders will also to take into account other factors when determining whether to loan you money. Things like your income, job history, and assets you own can factor into whether you can secure a loan.</p>\n<p><strong>How Can I Build and Improve My Credit History and Score?</strong></p>\n<p>Because your payment record and length of credit history make up about 50% of your credit score, it’s important you begin building a solid credit history as soon as you can. A good credit history along with a high credit score will serve you well later in life.</p>\n<p>The fastest and surest way to build up your credit history is to simply open up credit accounts and pay back the money when it’s due. Opening a credit card account is an easy way for young people to begin establishing their credit history.  A low interest, low minimum balance credit card can give a young person just starting out in life the opportunity to pay a credit balance on a regular basis in order to establish a solid positive payment record. Also, the earlier a young person obtains a credit card, the longer his credit history will be when he applies for that mortgage later in life.</p>\n<p>There is a danger, though. Credit cards can be a big time hazard for a young man just starting out on their own, as they allow you to spend money you don’t have. And because a young man’s schedule can be hectic and his life disorganized, he may forget to pay the monthly balance, incurring penalties and interest, and potentially plunging him into debt.<span style=\"text-decoration:underline\"> If you don’t have the income and level of responsibility to pay off your credit card balance every single month, don’t get a credit card. </span></p>\n<p>Even if you are responsible enough to get a credit card, maybe you just don’t like the idea of having one and want to avoid credit card debt altogether during your younger years. Smart move.</p>\n<p>So what if, for whatever reason, you want to avoid getting a credit card, is there any way to still build up your credit history or are you doomed to high interest rates when you apply for a mortgage later on?</p>\n<p>Despite what some people may tell you, <span style=\"text-decoration:underline\">it <em>is</em> possible to establish a credit history and improve your credit score without a credit card.</span> If you’re a college student, you likely have student loans. As soon as you graduate, start paying your loans back on a consistent basis. Boom. You’ve got a credit history.</p>\n<p>Another way to establish your history without a credit card is to apply for a small loan through your bank and have your parents co-sign on it. Make regular payments and pay it off as fast as you can. More credit history.</p>\n<p>But let’s say you’re a complete <a href=\"http://www.daveramsey.com/home/\">Dave Ramsey</a> devotee and decide to not use credit at all: no credit cards, no student loans, no car loans. Nothing. How can you secure a low interest rate when you’re ready to buy a house if you don’t have any credit history (assuming you haven’t reached the Ramsey pinnacle and are able to buy a house in full with cash!)?</p>\n<p>By applying for a <a href=\"http://www.prbc.com/\">PRBC Alternative Credit Score</a>. A PRBC Credit Score shows lenders you’re financially responsible and trustworthy by keeping track of how well you pay non-credit bills like rent, utilities, and insurance on a regular basis. It’s relatively new, but many lenders will accept a PRBC Alternative Credit Score when determining interest rates for mortgages and other loans.  Unlike your traditional credit history or scores that begin tallying as soon as you use credit, you’ll need to self-enroll to obtain a PRBC Alternative Credit Score.</p>\n<p><em><strong>Any other things a person heading out on their own for the first time needs to know about credit?

As the line between the offline and online world gets increasingly blurry, your online reputation <em>is</em> your reputation. Before you meet your freshman roommate, before you pick up a date, before you shake the hand of a potential employer…you better believe they’ve already Googled you, already formed a <em>first</em>, first impression about you, your interests, and what kind of person you are. Thus, if you’re not careful and conscious about the content you create online, you can end up shooting yourself in the foot in all areas of your life.</p>\n<h3><strong>Heading Out on Your Own…And Into a Fishbowl World</strong></h3>\n<p>Leaving for college or another kind of adventure after high school has long been an exciting and heady time. It’s an age where you’re experimenting with ideas and values, testing new freedoms, meeting new people, and often changing your mind about who you are and what you want out of life. One week you feel one way, and the next you feel another. During this process you often make mistakes, and do bone-headed things that twenty years later will still make you wonder, “<em>What was I thinking</em>?”</p>\n<p>Just a decade ago, only you, and a few of your closest friends, would have held the memory of those crazy and sometimes cringe-worthy moments. The only record of them could be found by digging up a private photo album or journal.</p>\n<p>Today…it’s a whole new ball game.</p>\n<p>Now, everything you do and say can potentially become part of your permanent and public record. Everybody’s got a smartphone and can snap a picture of you anywhere, anytime and post it online. And things that go up online about you and from you can remain there forever. Mistakes you made when you were just 19 can haunt you for the rest of your life. Being a young man used to mean you could entirely reinvent yourself by moving to a new place and making new friends, but now your online reputation will follow you wherever you go.</p>\n<p>I don’t mean to sound all doom and gloom about it. But that’s the sobering reality of living in the Internet Age, and it doesn’t help to bury one’s head in the sand and try to whatever that reality away. It absolutely doesn’t mean that college can’t still be the fun, spontaneous experience it’s always been; it just means you need to take a conscious, proactive approach to taking responsibility for what parts of that experience end up online and in the public eye.</p>\n<h3><strong>Why Is Proactively Managing Your Online Reputation So Important?</strong></h3>\n<p>One of the greatest things about the internet is that it is a giant pot that people can both add to and take from. This puts the most enormous wealth of knowledge in human history right at our fingertips and provides an endless amount of inspiration that can be added onto and “remixed.”</p>\n<p>The downside of the big internet pot, is that the moment you put something into the pot, <em>you pretty much lose all control over it</em>. Many viral embarrassments have started out as something someone just wanted to share with a few good friends. But those friends shared it with their friends, who shared it with their friends…on and on until it ended up on <em>Tosh.O</em>.</p>\n<p>There are essentially no guaranteed take backs when it comes to what you put online. You can erase your Facebook status, blog post, comment, tweet, or video, but someone else may very well have already shared it, copied it, taken a screenshot of it, or downloaded the video and reposted it somewhere else. How websites looked on a certain date in time are captured and archived on sites like the <a href=\"http://wayback.archive.org/web/20080501000000*/http://artofmanliness.com\">WayBack Machine</a> (<a href=\"http://web.archive.org/web/20080303193449/http://artofmanliness.com/\">take a look at AoM circa 2008!</a>). Emails that you thought you deleted forever can still sometimes be retrieved, and just because you deleted an email doesn’t mean the person you sent it to didn’t archive it. If someone else wants to post something of yours, you may not be able to get them to take it down without suing.</p>\n<p>All of which is to say, pretty every piece of digital content you create can potentially exist forever. And this digital record can be accessed by any of the 250 million internet users in the US, not to mention the 2 billion online all over the world.</p>\n<p>What’s on that record can have a big impact on both your personal and professional life.</p>\n<p>Your college’s admissions office may have Googled you when they looked over your application. As soon as your freshman roommate knew you’d be bunking with him, he Googled you. When you network with someone at a party and tell them about your great idea, they’ll Google you later. And 81% of singles say they Google or check the Facebook page of someone before meeting him or her for a date.</p>\n<p>Even though only 7% of Americans think their online reputation influences hiring decisions, in reality, 75% of US companies have made an online screening a formal part of the hiring process, 85% of recruiters and HR professionals say that having a positive online reputation influences their hiring decisions, and 70% of recruiters say they have rejected candidates based on something they found about them online. And since those numbers <a href=\"http://www.job-hunt.org/guides/DPD_Online-Reputation-Research_overview.pdf\">come from a study done in 2009</a>, they’re undoubtedly even higher now.</p>\n<p>What kinds of online discoveries cause recruiters and HR personnel to push your resume to the trash? This chart shows the most common red flags employers look for:</p>\n<div style=\"width:510px\"><img title=\"chart\" src=\"http://content.artofmanliness.com/uploads//2012/08/chart.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"500\" height=\"354\"><p>As you can see, it’s not just content you create that employers are checking out, it’s stuff your friends and colleagues post too. Be careful who you associate with.</p></div>\n<p>Some young folks may be tempted to respond by saying, “Well, if a company is going to reject me for posting pictures of my drunken revelry, I wouldn’t want to work for them anyway.” But that’s pretty short-sighted. I’d venture to say that these companies aren’t rejecting candidates so much because they like to drink or swear, but rather that their willingness to show off these behaviors publicly shows a lack of judgment and wisdom. Not at all an unreasonable assumption.</p>\n<p>The information that new friends and potential employers can find about you online may not even be true. Some people will try to verify it, some will not. And what they see will often come without any context – maybe you were being funny, maybe it’s an inside joke, but they won’t know that, they’ll simply make immediate judgments about what they find. This is why when it comes to managing your online reputation, you must be both proactive and defensive — deleting anything inappropriate,  wisely choosing the digital content you create, and purposefully creating positive content about yourself.</p>\n<h3><strong>Self-Reflect Before You Self-Reveal</strong></h3>\n<blockquote><p>“Young people in particular often self-reveal before they self-reflect. There is no eraser button today for youthful indiscretion.” –James Steyer</p></blockquote>\n<p>There are some practical ways to manage your online reputation, and we’ll get to them in a moment. But the first step in taking responsibility for your online presence is creating a <em>mindset</em> for how you want to approach your online life.</p>\n<p>Matt Ivester, the author of <a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1466242078/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=1466242078&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;tag=stucosuccess-20\"><em>lol..OMG!</em> </a>(despite the silly-sounding title, this is actually a great book, with solid advice from the guy who learned about online reputation management firsthand from his misadventures in founding Juicycampus.com), suggests three questions to ask yourself before you put something online:</p>\n<p><strong>1. Why are you doing this?</strong></p>\n<p>Why? This is the most important question of all, and one that unfortunately usually goes unasked and uncontemplated.</p>\n<p>Today’s colleges are welcoming the first “digital natives:” they’ve never known a time when the internet wasn’t a huge part of their lives. And even for those who are old enough to have used encyclopedias for elementary-school research papers, interacting and participating online has become so ubiquitous that it’s hard to imagine that life was ever any other way. This is just how things <em>are</em>, and we do what everyone else is doing, so much so that we hardly ever ask <em>why</em> we are doing those things.  Once we do start asking why, the answers are surprisingly hard to come up with and articulate.</p>\n<p>Why do you update your status or share a link on Facebook? Do you want to share news? Are you bored? Do you want to be thought clever? Are you trying to make someone else jealous? Do you want to see if people feel the same way as you? <em></em>Why?</p>\n<p>Why do you care how many likes or upvotes something you submit on Facebook or Reddit gets? Is it confirmation that you shared something with value? Why?</p>\n<p>Why do you leave comments on blog posts? Do you want the author of the blog to know that you appreciated the article? Do you think you have an insight to add that might help another reader? Do you want the author to know how and why they are wrong? Why? What do you hope to accomplish? Do you think it will change their mind? Is it because the psychological angst you feel when you think someone is wrong needs to be discharged? Why?</p>\n<p>Why do you participate in online forums? Does it provide a feeling of camaraderie? Do you like to hear others’ opinions? Why do you respond when you think those opinions are wrong? Why do you care what a stranger thinks about you? Why?</p>\n<p>When you ponder the why behind creating any kind of online content, from a status update to a YouTube video, you may come up with a reason that you find satisfactory and worthwhile. Or you may find that your motivation is hard to make sense of and decide it’s not worth your time. Either way, by asking <em>why</em>, you’ll become what Ivester calls “a conscious creator of content.”</p>\n<p><strong>2. Is now the right time?</strong></p>\n<p>The internet creates a perfect storm for impulse control: at the same time that it actively solicits impulsive communication and make satisfying those impulses incredibly easy, it makes taking back the results of those impulses incredibly difficult; it’s easy to hit “send” or “submit,” and quite hard to un-send and un-submit something.</p>\n<p>Facebook asks, “<em>What’s on your mind?</em>” while Twitter wants to know “<em>What’s happening?</em>” They owe their existence to people’s desire to share their thoughts, videos, and photographs – and they need to be constantly fed to survive and grow and make money. And blogs (including ours) want to engage readers and build community and so ask for comments. The internet is set up to encourage you to share whatever thought crosses your mind, and taking that thought from your cranium to the walls and screens of the digital world only takes a few clicks.</p>\n<p>But just because you <em>can</em> share your thoughts on impulse doesn’t mean you <em>should</em>. Not only because you probably haven’t thought through the <em>why </em>behind wanting to share first, but because strong impulses are usually born from strong emotions: anger, depression, and grief, or from chemically-altered states (like being drunk). When you spout off and share personal feelings while emotional or trashed, you will likely come to regret it once those strong emotions fade or you sober up.</p>\n<p>The best thing to do when you feel you’re dealing with an impulse to put something online that you might regret later, is just to sit on it. The internet creates a false sense of <em>immediacy</em>, giving you an overwhelming feeling that you have to respond <em>now</em>. But what you’ll find is that something that felt super urgent and mega important to say in the moment, will seem totally pointless when you wake up the next morning.</p>\n<p>One method I use to thwart impulsive responses is to imagine myself living before the internet. If I feel a burning urge to tell the author of an article what a chucklehead he is, I think of reading a magazine in the 80s, and how I would have had no outlet to express my opinion about it besides writing up a letter to the editor or talking to my wife or close friends about it. Or if something annoys me and I want to rant about it on Facebook, I think of a time before Facebook when I would have had no choice but to keep my rant to myself. It makes me realize that just as sharing whatever crosses your mind wasn’t necessary then, it’s not necessary now. The fine-folks of the 80s, while they made some questionable fashion-choices, weren’t any less happy than we are now that we’re able to shout what we’re feeling and thinking to everyone 24/7.</p>\n<p><strong>3. How controversial do you want to be?</strong></p>\n<p>The younger generation  (including those my age) was raised with a lot of rhetoric about how special and unique they are, how important it is to be “authentic,” and that it’s good to be “transparent.” This can lead folks to throw caution to wind about what they share online because, “I’m just trying to be me! And if other people don’t like it, they can bite me!”</p>\n<p>But just because you can now display your opinions and personality to a greater number of people than ever before, doesn’t mean you should, or that the more you share, the more authentic you are. Going back to my suggestion of thinking about life before the internet, people used to only be able to share their quirks with a close circle of family and friends, and they weren’t any less themselves than we are (actually they were probably more themselves since they didn’t get instant feedback on all of their quirks).</p>\n<p>Examining the meaning of authenticity isn’t within the purview of this post (although it will be a future series), but suffice it to say for now that the ideal for many of the great men of the past was not transparency, but <a href=\"http://artofmanliness.com/2009/07/14/in-praise-of-sprezzatura-the-compleat-gentleman-giveaway/\">sprezzatura</a> – only revealing themselves to others slowly as a relationship of trust developed. You may want to “be yourself” by trumpeting your religious, social, and political beliefs online every chance you get, but if those meme’s you keep flooding Facebook with is the only thing new acquaintances know about you, they may decide they don’t want to get to know you before they even do — they’ll miss the complexity of your character that would have shown through over time…that you’re both a liberal <em>and </em>a rabid gun owner, or a fervent Christian <em>and</em> a scientist, or a zealous vegetarian <em>and</em> a Marine.</p>\n<p>The three questions above can go a long way to helping you judiciously choose what and what not to post online. A final question to consider is what the general public might think of the content if for some reason what you post went viral or you were suddenly thrust into national prominence. Would it embarrass your family? What impression would a stranger have of it? You and your friends might think it’s funny, but would others find it offensive? You never know who’s going to see your post, what’s going to be dug up on you later, and who might be looking at your phone.</p>\n<h3><strong>How to Manage Your Online Reputation</strong></h3>\n<p>Managing your online reputation involves both deleting content you don’t want out there and creating content you do. Follow the steps below that Ivester and others have suggested, and complete each step right after you read it. This is the kind of thing that’s easy to put off indefinitely. Do it now.</p>\n<p><strong>1. Google yourself.</strong></p>\n<p>Before you can know what actions to take to manage your online reputation, you need to know what’s already out there. To do this, first deactivate Google’s customized search – when you typically do a Google search, the results Google brings up are based on things like your location, what you’ve clicked on before, and things your friends like. But you want to see what would come up if someone else searched for you. <a href=\"http://support.google.com/accounts/bin/answer.py?hl=en&amp;answer=54048\">Here’s how to take off the customized search feature</a>.</p>\n<p>If you have a common name like “Rob Smith,” then search for your name with a qualifier like, “Rob Smith St. Louis,” or “Rob Smith Tulane University.”</p>\n<p>After you look at Google’s results for you, check out other search engines like Bing and Yahoo as well.</p>\n<p>When you look at the results that come up for your name, try to imagine what conclusions someone might reach about you if they had no other context for that content, and knew nothing else about you.</p>\n<p><strong>2. Try to remove content that you don’t want showing up in search results anymore.</strong></p>\n<p>After you do a search for yourself, it’s time to try to delete things that showed up that you’d rather not have out there anymore. Maybe you signed up for an internet forum with your real name. Maybe you left a comment on a blog post under your real name. Maybe you wrote a review or a blog post that you now feel is too controversial. Some of these things you can delete yourself.</p>\n<p>If you can’t delete something yourself, like a blog post comment on another person’s blog, then try to contact the owner of the site to see if they will remove it for you. They may or may not, but the nicer you are about it, the greater the chance of them helping you, so make your request as civil and appreciative as possible.</p>\n<p>If you can’t find the contact information for the site owner, try the site <a href=\"http://www.whois.net/\">WHOis</a>. Website registrars are required to publish the contact information for the person who registered the domain. Oftentimes when you look up a site on WHOis, you’ll find that the owner has decided to keep their direct contact information private and have instead given a proxy email address. Either way, your email will end up in the same place.</p>\n<p>Understand that even if you’re successful at removing the offending content from a site, it may take a few days or even weeks before it’s reflected in search engine results. Also, understand that the offending item really hasn’t “gone away.” There’s a chance that it has been archived on the WayBack Machine. Remember, what’s put on the internet stays on the internet forever.</p>\n<p>Moving forward, be extremely judicious when using your real name online.</p>\n<p><strong>3. Proactively create a positive first impression online.</strong></p>\n<p>Your best bet in managing your online reputation is proactively creating positive content about yourself that pushes the bad stuff off of the first few pages of search engines. Set up accounts with large social networking sites that typically rank high on Google and other search engines. Twitter, LinkedIn, Facebook, and Google+ profiles are often on the first page when you look up someone’s name. Set up accounts with them and post stuff that you’d be proud to have your name associated with.</p>\n<p>The best thing you can do to ensure positive stuff associated with your name is at the top of search results is to start a blog and update it regularly. If you can, try to secure a domain name with your given name for your blog. What should you write about on your blog? You can publish your resume (redacting phone numbers and addresses, of course), write posts sharing insights in an expertise you might have, or use it to create a portfolio of your work if you’re a freelancer. Whatever it is, make sure it’s stuff you want associated with your name.</p>\n<p>Cross-link your blog and all your social networking profiles together: put your link to Facebook and Twitter on your blog, a link to your LinkedIn profile and blog on your Facebook account, and so on.</p>\n<p>Even if you don’t plan on using Twitter or Google+ or even putting anything on your blog, it doesn’t hurt to have your name registered with those accounts and domain. You don’t want some Joe Schmo mucking up your good name with a bunch of crazy online antics.</p>\n<p><strong>4. Adjust privacy settings on Facebook and clean up your Facebook Profile</strong>.</p>\n<p>To ensure that potential employers or love interests only see the best of you when they look you up on Facebook, make the following adjustments:</p>\n<div style=\"width:296px\"><img title=\"strangers\" src=\"http://content.artofmanliness.com/uploads//2012/08/strangers.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"286\" height=\"203\"><p>First, take a look at how your profile page looks to the public. If you see any information visible that you don’t want strangers to see, make a note of it.</p></div>\n<div style=\"width:377px\"><img title=\"profile1\" src=\"http://content.artofmanliness.com/uploads//2012/08/profile1.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"367\" height=\"363\"><p>To change what’s visible on your profile page, click “About.”</p></div>\n<div style=\"width:510px\"><img title=\"profile\" src=\"http://content.artofmanliness.com/uploads//2012/08/profile.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"500\" height=\"396\"><p>Click “Edit” on the next page.  On each segment select “Friends” if you don’t want anybody who’s not your FB friend to see a particular piece of information. For networking reasons, I’ve left my job and school information visible to the public.</p></div>\n<div style=\"width:510px\"><img title=\"privacy1\" src=\"http://content.artofmanliness.com/uploads//2012/08/privacy1.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"500\" height=\"175\"><p>Visit the <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/settings/?tab=privacy\">Facebook Privacy Settings</a> page and adjust all your privacy settings so only your friends can see photos and status updates you make.</p></div>\n<div style=\"width:510px\"><img title=\"timelinetagging\" src=\"http://content.artofmanliness.com/uploads//2012/08/timelinetagging.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"500\" height=\"306\"><p>On the privacy settings page, update what your friends can share about you under “Timeline and Tagging.” Enable the ability to review and approve posts or photos that you are tagged in <em>before</em> they’re published on your Timeline. You can also disable Facebook’s tag suggestion when your friends upload photos that look like you. You don’t want your name tagged in an unflattering photo or post.</p></div>\n<div style=\"width:510px\"><img title=\"pastposts\" src=\"http://content.artofmanliness.com/uploads//2012/08/pastposts.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"500\" height=\"63\"><p>While you’re on the privacy settings page, limit who can see posts from the past. Even if you used to post everything publicly, this will retroactively make those posts private.</p></div>\n<div style=\"width:510px\"><img title=\"removetag\" src=\"http://content.artofmanliness.com/uploads//2012/08/removetag.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"500\" height=\"380\"><p>Review the photos that you’re tagged in and untag yourself from any unflattering photos. While you’re at it, you might ask your friend to remove the photo if it’s something you don’t want out there. Even if you’re not tagged in the pic, it could come back to haunt you.</p></div>\n<div style=\"width:410px\"><img title=\"cheat\" src=\"http://content.artofmanliness.com/uploads//2012/08/cheat.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"400\" height=\"234\"><p>Leave groups and unlike pages that may be seen as controversial…or just dumb. At least set the privacy settings on them so only your FB friends can see the pages you like. <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/help/?faq=184794238235904\">Here’s how</a>.</p></div>\n<p><strong>5. Be more conscious of what you share and whom you share it with on Facebook.</strong></p>\n<p>Ask the three questions we covered above before posting something on Facebook. That will save you a lot of grief.</p>\n<p>Also, take into account if what you’re about to share is appropriate and relevant to ALL your Facebook friends. You don’t need to share your weekend plans with your old boss and former professors. In real life, you adjust what you talk about depending on your company — do the same on Facebook. Create lists on Facebook for close family/friends, acquaintances, professional colleagues, people that are the same religion as you, people you enjoy talking politics with, etc. Before posting something, ask yourself if this is something <em>all</em> your friends would be interested in or is better for a specific list of your friends. And even if you’re only posting for a list of close friends, still keep in mind what others would think if that status or photo got shared with people outside the list. It could happen.</p>\n<p><strong>6. Create strong passwords for your accounts.</strong></p>\n<p>If the recent<a href=\"http://www.wired.com/gadgetlab/2012/08/apple-amazon-mat-honan-hacking/all/\"> story of tech writer Mat Honan’s online life being completely demolished by hackers</a> doesn’t motivate you to strengthen your online security, then I don’t know what will. Create strong passwords for all your accounts and change them every six months. A strong password is at least 8 characters long and includes at least one special character (&amp;!#) and both upper and lower case letters. Your passwords shouldn’t be the same for all your accounts. To manage all your passwords, use an app like <a href=\"https://lastpass.com/\">LastPass</a>.</p>\n<p>To reduce the chance of getting hacked, <a href=\"http://lifehacker.com/5932700/please-turn-on-two+factor-authentication\">enable two step authentication</a>. Here’s how to do it on <a href=\"http://support.google.com/accounts/bin/answer.py?hl=en&amp;answer=180744\">Google</a> (if you use Gmail) and <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/help/?faq=148233965247823#What-is-Login-Approvals?-How-do-I-turn-this-setting-on?\">Facebook</a>.</p>\n<p><strong>7. Use passwords on your laptop and mobile devices. </strong></p>\n<p><strong></strong>An unattended laptop or mobile device provides a devilish opportunity for friends or random strangers to mess with your online life. I know several people who had to do a lot of scrambling to recover from an offensive tweet sent from an unattended iPhone by a mischievous friend. Avoid that. Enable password protection on all your mobile devices.</p>\n<p><strong>6. Set up a Google Alert for your name. </strong></p>\n<p>Keep your finger on the pulse of what’s said about you on the web by setting up a <a href=\"http://www.google.com/alerts\">Google Alert</a> for yor name.  Just enter your name as a search query and Google Alert will email you a digest once a week (or daily if you want) of all the new content that’s hit the web with your name in it.</p>\n<h3><strong>Conclusion</strong></h3>\n<p>The internet is an amazing educational, social, and networking tool — you just need to use it wisely. Using it too little can be just as damaging to your personal and professional life as using it too much. Be a “conscious content creator” and use sound wisdom and judgement in deciding where you personally want to draw the line between your public and private life.</p>\n<p><em><strong>Any other tips on managing your online reputation?

To save money, you’ll very likely have to bunk with a roommate or two to cut down on living costs. While roommates can save you money (and provide camaraderie and companionship), they can pose many challenges. Any time you put two people with different backgrounds and lifestyles together under one roof, there’s bound to be conflict and awkward social moments.</p>\n<p>Learning how to effectively manage the roommate relationship is an essential skill for every young man to have. Not only will it make living with roommates during your bachelor years easier, it also prepares you in many ways for when you settle down and start a family of your own.</p>\n<p>Below we provide some tips on how to make living with roommates as drama-free as possible. The advice is based on my personal experience of living with dozens of roommates when I was single, many of whom came from completely different cultures than me.</p>\n<p><img title=\"bros6\" src=\"http://content.artofmanliness.com/uploads//2012/08/bros6.jpeg\" alt=\"\"></p>\n<p><strong>Establish ground rules from the get-go. </strong>A friend of mine who left home a year earlier than me summed up this guideline thusly: “<em>Establish rules before you need them</em>.” Don’t wait until someone forgets to pay their share of the rent to figure out what happens when someone doesn’t pay the rent. Neither should you wait until the night before a big final to have the discussion about your roommate’s proclivity for blasting his TV at 2 AM in the morning.</p>\n<p>The best thing you can do to get along with your roommate is to sit down with him the first day you move in (if you’re in the dorms) or before you sign a lease (if you’re getting an apartment) to discuss the rules of the apartment/dorm. Don’t make this conversation combative. Don’t be defensive and uptight. You want everyone to be as open and frank as possible. You can say something like, “Just so we’re on the same page and so we can avoid any conflicts in the future, can we lay down some ground rules for the apartment?”</p>\n<p>What sort of rules should you establish? Here’s a list of a few questions you might consider bringing up in your conversation with your roommate:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>When should everyone pay their share of the rent and utility bills?</li>\n<li>Who cleans what and when?  Also discuss the consequences if people don’t do their chores.</li>\n<li>What are the rules on dishes? Do dirty dishes get put in the dishwasher right away or can you leave them in the sink? Who unloads the dishes?</li>\n<li>Is smoking inside allowed?</li>\n<li>What are everyone’s drinking habits?</li>\n<li>What sort of expenses will we share? Cleaning supplies? Garbage bags? Toilet paper? Any shared food expenses like coffee and milk?</li>\n<li>What are the rules on bringing guests over? Can friends crash in the living room? How big of a heads-up should everyone give before having a party or bringing guests over? Do we even need to give a heads-up?</li>\n<li>What about significant others? Can they spend the night? Can they hang out all day, every day? Can we give them duplicates of our keys? You’ve got to be careful with this one. I’ve seen several roommate relationships go south because a girlfriend slowly turned into a non-paying third tenant. Nip that in the bud from the get-go.</li>\n<li>Speaking of significant others, if you’re sharing a room with a roommate, you might want to establish some sort of “Do Not Disturb” signal. It will save you from some awkward walk-ins.</li>\n<li>What are the rules on morning and nighttime noise levels?</li>\n<li>Are pets allowed?</li>\n<li>What temperature are we going to keep the thermostat set at? (You’d be surprised how contentious this issue can be with roommates.)</li>\n<li>Have everyone share whether they’re neat freaks or slobs. It’s best to know from the outset so you can manage expectations about what constitutes a clean apartment.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>A lot of roommate conflict boils down to a mismatch of expectations. Roommates expect each other to be mind-readers, and to live up to expectations that they’ve never actually verbalized, but simply expect the other guy to magically know and adhere to. When the expectations aren’t met, resentment follows. By sitting down together before you move in, you’ll know what to expect. For whatever psychological reason, even when someone doesn’t meet your standards, if you already know that they won’t, you won’t get bent out of shape about it.</p>\n<p>By the way, I know some will feel resistant to the idea of drawing up ground rules, feeling like you’re young and want to keep things loose and that because you’re buddies, things will just naturally work out. Maybe they will, maybe they won’t. Think of the ground rules as friendship insurance — getting a policy isn’t the most pleasant task, and maybe you won’t need it, but if you do, it can keep your friendships intact and make the whole experience smoother and more enjoyable.</p>\n<p><strong>Be flexible and willing to compromise (but stand firm on your deal-breakers). </strong> During your conversation about ground rules, you and your roommates will inevitably run into disagreements. Be flexible and work to compromise in order to accommodate each other’s differing lifestyles. For example, if you’re a night owl and your roommate is not, you should be willing to keep the noise down after he goes to bed, and he should in turn try to get ready quietly in the morning when you’re still snoozing. If there are some things that are deal-breakers for you, don’t be afraid to stand your ground. So if you don’t want any smoking in the house, say so. If your roommate isn’t willing to adjust to your request, find a new place or roommate.</p>\n<p><strong>Follow the Golden Rule.</strong> The key to managing roommate relationships is be mutually respectful and considerate of one another. You will be well served by following the Golden Rule.  If you don’t like walking into your living room to unexpectedly find a stranger sacked out on the couch, don’t invite friends over without giving your roommate a heads-up; don’t touch your roommate’s stuff without asking permission first; don’t leave your dirty dishes in the common area. You get the idea.</p>\n<p><strong>Have a weekly sync-up meeting. </strong>One activity that I found immensely useful in managing and preventing roommate conflicts is having a weekly meeting to sync up with each other. At this meeting you can discuss bills that need to be paid and chores that need to be done. It’s also a good time to let your roommate know about guests that are coming over in the coming week, so they have a heads-up.</p>\n<p>The sync-up meeting is a good time to bring up and resolve any issues that are causing friction between roommates. Again, don’t be combative when you bring up concerns. Just tell your roommate what’s been bothering you and ask what the two of you can do to resolve the issue.</p>\n<p>I’d also use this time to ask my roommate if there’s anything I can do to help him out that week. For example, if I knew that he was working overtime to finish a school paper, I’d ask if there were any chores or errands I could help out with that week. My roommates would do the same for me when I was getting bogged down.</p>\n<p>Another nice feature about the weekly sync-up meeting is that it carries over nicely to married life. Kate and I do something similar in our own relationship. It’s a practice that has definitely contributed to our success in both our marriage and our business.</p>\n<p><img title=\"roommates\" src=\"http://content.artofmanliness.com/uploads//2012/08/roommates.jpeg\" alt=\"\"></p>\n<p><strong>There will be conflict. Address it calmly and directly instead of avoiding it.</strong>  Conflict and disagreements are a normal part of any relationship, be it in a marriage or with a roommate. So don’t be surprised if you and your roommate don’t get along all the time. Unfortunately, many young people handle conflict by simply acting like it doesn’t exist or hoping that the conflict will magically resolve itself. Managing conflict like this will only turn small issues into big ones. Don’t avoid conflict. Don’t leave each other passive aggressive notes. Instead, <a href=\"http://artofmanliness.com/2011/12/04/rip-off-the-band-aid/\">rip off that band-aid</a> and understand that “pain now is better than pain deferred.” So if you notice that your roommate is slacking off on his chores or is <del>stealing </del>borrowing your food, bring it up as soon as you can. Don’t let the conflict fester until it blows up like a puss-filled boil.</p>\n<p><strong>Understand you don’t have to be best friends with your roommate. </strong>One mistake I’ve seen many young people make when entering roommate relationships for the first time is having unreasonably high-expectations about the relationship. They expect that they’ll be best buddies with their roommates and do everything together and never get in fights. Their roommate, on the other hand, prefers to have his space and spend time with his own friends. This mismatch in expectations can cause friction in the relationship from the get-go.</p>\n<p>To prevent this mismatch of expectations, go in understanding that you and your roommate might not be best buds, but merely roommates who respect each other. While you should certainly invite your roommate out to a party or a ballgame, don’t get offended if he declines. That’s his prerogative.</p>\n<p>Even if you’re rooming with your best friend from high school, understand that just because you’re good friends doesn’t mean you’ll naturally be good roommates. I’ve seen the most volatile roommate fights between people who were once best friends. The problem usually stems from poor expectation management. Best buds naively assume that they’ll get along without establishing ground rules or having weekly sync-up meetings. But they don’t. Don’t skip those steps if you’re moving in with a good friend.</p>\n<p>Friendships can also deteriorate if you rely on each other for all your social and emotional needs. Even if you’re two manly peas in a pod, don’t spend all your time with each other. Make other friends, find different interests, and do things separately sometimes.</p>\n<p><strong>Use Google Docs and Google Calendars to manage everything. </strong>During my roommate days, the only tool we had to manage shared expenses and chores was a whiteboard. My roommates and I would post rent due dates and the chores list for the week. And of course, the whiteboard was used occasionally for scribbling passive aggressive notes about some grievance.</p>\n<p>Take a tip from <a href=\"http://www.apartmenttherapy.com/use-google-docs-to-manage-dorm-92647\">Apartment Therapy</a> and upgrade from the humble whiteboard to the Cloud by using shared Google documents and calendars to manage your roommate experience:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Create a Google spreadsheet to manage rent and other shared expenses.</li>\n<li>Another spreadsheet can be used to keep track of chores and whether they’ve been done.</li>\n<li>Create and share a Google Calendar just for your roommates so you keep everyone abreast of when guests are coming over or dates for parties. You can also put rent and utility due dates on the calendar and have Google send everyone an email reminder when the date rolls around.</li>\n<li>Use a shared Google write document to share random notes.</li>\n</ul>\n<div>\n<p>If your roomies don’t use Google, you’ll have to convince them to sign up to take advantage of this system.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.goodmate.co/\">GoodMate</a> is a new web app that allows you to manage the roommate experience from a central dashboard. You can manage shared expenses, chores, and calendars all within GoodMate. GoodMate will email your roommates with reminders to pay rent or do their chores. The only downside to GoodMate is that you have to sign-in with Facebook. If you have a roommate who doesn’t use Facebook, you’ll have to use the whiteboard. And look into whether he hasn’t time-traveled to your apartment from the year 2002.</p>\n</div>\n<h3><strong>I Can’t Stand My Roommate. What Can I Do?</strong></h3>\n<p>Despite doing your darnedest to make it work, your relationship with your roommate has reached a point that you can’t imagine living another day with him. What can you do?</p>\n<p>If you’re living in a dorm, go talk to your RA. They might be able to help you make a room switch. I had a friend in college who decided to get assigned a random dorm roommate for the “experience.” Little did she know that the roommate assigned to her would turn out to be certifiably crazy. After a few weeks of trying to make the relationship work, my friend asked for a new dorm room. She got one with little trouble.</p>\n<p>If you’re living in an apartment, getting rid of a bad roommate or moving out is a bit trickier because of the lease agreement. Unless you have enough money to pay for the months remaining in your lease agreement, plus an early termination fee, moving out might not be an option. You could always evict your roommate, but that process can take time and makes an already awkward situation even awkwarder.  The eviction process is a bit complex for this post, so I might revisit it later in a future post if there’s any interest.</p>\n<p>Unless your apartment roommate is not paying their share of the rent or is conducting illegal activities in your apartment, your best bet is to wait until the lease is up and go your separate ways. It will be a learning experience for sure.</p>\n<p><em><strong>Any other tips for the young man living with roommates for the first time?

Even if you plan on becoming an entrepreneur and your own boss, many businesses <a title=\"The Company Man’s Guide to Starting a Side Hustle — Part I: Confronting Your Objections\" href=\"http://artofmanliness.com/2012/07/30/the-company-mans-guide-to-starting-a-side-hustle-part-i-confronting-your-objections/\">start off as a side hustle</a> to your 9-5 before becoming a full-time gig, and plenty of millionaires spent time in their younger years waiting tables and filing papers.</p>\n<p>Knowing how to ace a job interview is a skill every man can master. There are numerous ways to hone that skill and special considerations for different kinds of interviews, and we’ll definitely cover those specific ins and outs down the road. But for this series, we present the most important basics for job interview success — these essentials work whether you’re applying for a job at a Pizza Hut or a law firm.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align:center\"><img title=\"interview\" src=\"http://content.artofmanliness.com/uploads//2012/08/interview.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"350\" height=\"545\"></p>\n<p><strong>Clean-up your online presence. </strong>Many employers are using the internet to screen job applicants. And it’s not just big corporations that are doing this. I know a manager of a restaurant here in town that checks the Facebook account of people who submit applications. What are employers looking for? They’re looking for any red flags that indicate you might be a bad employee — pictures of you toking it up or funneling beer or status updates where you use excessively crude language or bad mouth a former or current employer will probably land your application in the trash.</p>\n<p>We’ll be going into more detail about how to clean-up and manage your online reputation later this month. Stay tuned.</p>\n<p><strong>Have a list of references that your interviewer can actually call. </strong>Every job application you submit, whether for the local ice cream parlor or a fancy corporation, will probably ask for a list of references. While many hiring managers don’t actually call the references you give, in the off chance that they do, you want your references to be people that can honestly put in a good word for you. Before you list a person as a reference, shoot them an email if possible and ask if you can use them as a reference. That way, if they do get a call from an employer, they’ll be prepared and won’t be stammering to come up with something good to say about you, let alone remember who you were.</p>\n<p><strong>Research the employer. </strong>Know something about the company or business you’re applying for. First, you want to know that the job and working environment is a good fit for you. Second, you want to be prepared to answer questions like: “Why do you want to work here?” or “What do you know about our company?” Third, knowing a lot about the company will enable you to ask your own questions about the job, which is a key way to impress the interviewer (see below).</p>\n<p><strong>Know your resume and what you wrote down on your application. </strong>If you’re applying for a job that requires you to submit a resume, have everything you put in your resume down pat and be prepared to elaborate if asked. Same goes for anything you put on a job application. Be prepared to answer any questions about what you put down.</p>\n<p>And it should go without saying, but be completely honest with what you put on your resume or application. I know one young woman in law school who put on her resume that she spoke Spanish fluently, which in reality meant she had taken three years of college Spanish and could sort of stumble through a very rudimentary conversation. Little did she know that the hiring attorney had lived in Spain for several years and spoke Spanish like a native. After a few minutes of questions, the hiring attorney started asking her questions in Spanish. She had no idea what he was saying. Needless to say, she didn’t get a second interview.</p>\n<p><strong>Dress appropriately. </strong>You want to put your best foot forward during your interview, and your appearance is a big part of that. It’s the first part of your <a href=\"http://artofmanliness.com/2008/02/19/make-yourself-stick-with-these-first-impression-tips/\">first impression</a>. You want to look presentable, well-groomed, and dressed appropriately for the type of job you’re applying for.</p>\n<p>Just use some common sense when determining what to wear to the interview. I think a good general rule to follow is to dress one notch up from how people who already work there dress. So if you’re applying to a restaurant where the waiters wear jeans and t-shirts, wear khakis and a polo shirt to the interview. If you’re applying to a place where people wear khakis and polos, then wear a button-down shirt and khakis to the interview. If everyone wears khakis and button-down shirts, then do likewise, but add a sport coat and tie. You get the idea.</p>\n<p>Here’s <a href=\"http://artofmanliness.com/2008/12/18/interviewing-in-recession/\">an article</a> and a <a href=\"http://artofmanliness.com/2011/12/08/how-to-dress-for-a-job-interview/\">quick visual guide</a> on how to dress for more professional jobs.</p>\n<p><strong>Be punctual. </strong>If you’re applying to a part-time wage job, one of the most important attributes an employer is looking for in an employee is reliability. Every employer will tell you…reliable people are hard to find! Employers want to know the people they hire will show up for the shift they’re assigned to, at the time they’re scheduled, and will come in ready to work. If you stroll into your interview late, what do you think that tells the employer? That you’ll likely be a tardy employee.</p>\n<p><a title=\"A Man Is Punctual: The Reasons You’re Late and How to Always Be on Time\" href=\"http://artofmanliness.com/2012/07/18/a-man-is-punctual-the-reasons-youre-late-and-how-to-always-be-on-time/\">Practice the manly art of punctuality</a>. Show up to the business 5-10 minutes early (more if it’s a professional job with a waiting area, less if it’s a casual job with no place for you to wait), let somebody know that you’re there for your interview, and wait until the manager is ready for you. If you’re running late because of an emergency, call the interviewer and let them know.</p>\n<p>If the manager makes you wait, don’t act perturbed. That’s their prerogative. Just keep being your pleasant self. When the manager finally comes and gets you and apologizes for making you wait, act like it wasn’t a big deal at all, even if you had to wait 15 minutes. Of course, you should take into account a manager’s tardiness when determining if you’ll accept a job offer. Having an unreliable boss can make a job a pain.</p>\n<p><strong>Understand that the interview begins as soon as you walk through the door. </strong>As soon as you walk through the door, the interview has started. Assume that everyone you encounter before and after you even meet the person actually responsible for hiring will have a say in whether you get the job or not. And by everyone, I mean everyone: janitors, secretaries, hostesses, and customers included.  Hiring managers often ask their subordinates what they thought of job applicants. If you were rude to the secretary or cold and aloof with the hostess at the restaurant, kiss your chances of landing the job goodbye. Treat everyone with the utmost respect and be your best self.</p>\n<p><strong>Shake hands, smile, and look the employer in the eye. </strong>Display confidence during your interview. As soon as you see the hiring manager walk towards you, stand up and walk towards her with a smile and an open hand. <a href=\"http://artofmanliness.com/2011/08/22/manly-handshake/\">Give a firm handshake</a> and say, “Nice to meet you!” Follow the hiring manager to where the interview will take place and don’t sit until she says, “Take a seat.”</p>\n<p><strong>Sit comfortably straight in your chair. </strong>Sit up straight, but comfortably straight. You don’t want to look like a robot. Don’t cross your arms in front of you — that makes you look defensive. Just rest them gently on your thighs. Don’t be afraid to gesture as you answer questions — it shows you’re excited. Avoid any nervous ticks like checking your watch, tapping your foot, or touching your face and hair.</p>\n<p><strong>Show excitement and interest. </strong>As someone who has been on the other side of the desk in conducting job interviews, nothing is worse than talking to someone who shows no interest or excitement about the job. All I’m thinking is: “Why am I wasting my time with this person who doesn’t even want to be here?” So cleaning bathrooms isn’t the most exciting job in the world. But if you want the job, you darn well better act like there’s nothing you’d rather do than clean bathrooms. Remember this: job interviews are a form of theater and everyone has a role to play. Your role is “eager job applicant who is ready to roll up his sleeves and get to work, even if the work isn’t all that glamorous.”</p>\n<p><strong>Keep answers brief (but not too brief).</strong>  Don’t just give one word answers, but don’t keep blabbing on and on. Answers to most basic interview questions shouldn’t take more than a minute to answer.</p>\n<p><strong>Rehearse answers to common interview questions. </strong>Again, job interviews are a form of theater. Just as you’d rehearse your lines for a play, so too should you rehearse your lines for a job interview. There are plenty of sites with huge lists of common job interview questions. Print them off and rehearse them by yourself and with a friend in a mock interview. Below I highlight a few of the most common interview questions and offer some suggestions on how to answer them:</p>\n<blockquote style=\"border:0px;background-color:#ffffff\"><p><strong>“Tell me about yourself.” </strong>I hate this question because it’s so incredibly broad. But interviewers like to ask it because it shows how you handle unstructured situations, so you might as well be ready for it. Whatever you do, don’t respond with: “What do you want to know?” Nor should you launch into your life story…”Well, I was born in McAllen, Texas, and I have a dog named Mabel…” Despite how the question is worded, employers don’t actually want to know about you — <em>they want to know something about you that’s relevant to the open job.</em> Tell them why you’re applying for this job and highlight any strengths that you’ll bring to the business. “I’m a freshman at the University of Oklahoma studying history. I worked as a waiter this summer in Edmond, and now that I’m living in Norman, I’m looking for another job waiting tables. I think I’ve got the kind of enthusiastic personality that would fit really well with your restaurant.”</p>\n<p><strong>“What are your strengths?” </strong>Pick two or three of your biggest strengths and have a few specific examples that offer a <em>concrete</em> and memorable demonstration of those qualities.</p>\n<p><strong>“What are your weaknesses?”</strong> Don’t say “I can’t think of any.” Don’t go the cliche “here’s a weakness that’s actually kind of a strength” route (“I’m too much of a perfectionist!”). And don’t overshare. This isn’t a time to confess your weird habits. Come up with one thing that isn’t a huge deal, and then — here’s the important part — explain what you’re doing to correct it. This is what employers are trying to get at with this question. They want to see if you’re self-aware enough to see deficiencies in yourself and that you’re able to take actions to correct them. So you might say, “I used to be really unorganized and scatter-brained. That was okay in high school, but this first semester in college my grades started to suffer. So I started studying about productivity and time management and now <a title=\"Heading Out on Your Own – Day 5: Create a Weekly Attack Plan\" href=\"http://artofmanliness.com/2012/08/05/weekly-plan/\">I plan my weeks and days out religiously</a>. I’ve never been more on the ball.”</p>\n<p><strong>“I see you don’t have any experience in _____. Why do you think you would succeed in this position?” </strong>If this is the first job you’ve ever applied for or it’s a job in a field you have no experience in, this question can throw you for a loop. If you don’t have any experience in the position you’re applying, look for skills you’ve demonstrated in other areas of your life that can cross-over to the job. Have you done community service? Were you the captain of your cross-country team? Did you help plan the prom? Did you take care of your sick grandfather? Use experiences from all areas of your life to show you’re prepared for the job.</p></blockquote>\n<p><strong>Have some questions for the interviewer ready. </strong>Interviewers usually finish things up by asking, “So do you have any questions for <em>us</em>?” The incorrect response is, “Nope! You answered all my questions.”</p>\n<p>Always have some thoughtful questions ready to ask the hiring manager. Again, it shows that you’re interested in the job. Moreover, it demonstrates that you’re not a potato head and that you actually have the brain power to formulate a thoughtful question. Most importantly, it’s your chance to find out if the job really is a good fit for <em>you.</em></p>\n<p>Here are some possible questions to ask about the job:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>“What characteristics does your ideal employee have?”</li>\n<li>“What’s the culture like here?”</li>\n<li>“Why do people like to work here?</li>\n<li>“What’s the training like?”</li>\n<li>If you’re applying for a service job, ask whether the business experiences any “rushes” and how they handle them.</li>\n<li>“What’s the next step? When will you be making a decision? Can I follow up with you in a week?”</li>\n</ul>\n<p>While you should definitely ask your interviewer questions, don’t ask a question that he already answered during the course of the interview. So, if the employer gave a rundown of your potential job duties at the beginning of the interview, don’t ask, “So what will I be doing here?” at the end of it. You just demonstrated that you suck at paying attention. Also avoid questions that make you look lazy or that might raise red flags; for example, “Um, do you do background checks?” or “How soon can I ask for time off?”</p>\n<p><strong>Thank the interviewer for their time.</strong> When the interview is finished, shake the interviewer’s hand, and thank him for his time. Make it sincere. Last impressions count nearly as much as first ones do. If it’s a more professional job, and one you really want, stick <a href=\"http://artofmanliness.com/2008/10/23/the-art-of-thank-you-note-writing/\">a thank you note</a> in the mail the same day as the interview. Some folks say the thank you note is outdated these days and just to send an email the same day. But personally, if I got such an email, I’d think, “Yes, I know. You just thanked me a few hours ago.” An email is about on the same level as an in-person thank you, so it seems redundant. And most people get so much email, they really don’t look forward to more. They’ll forget about it in the time it takes to click <em>delete</em>. A hand-written note, on the other hand, is something different, requires more effort, and brings you up again in their memory a couple of days later in a positive way.</p>\n<p><em><strong>Any other general job interview tips for a young man just starting out life?

I know. You’re probably thinking, “Does Brett think all young men are a bunch of uncouth ignoramuses who need an article reminding them to practice basic hygiene?”  No. No, I don’t.</p>\n<p>But from my own personal experience and observing the lives of young men heading out on their own for the first time, I do know that keeping up with regular hygiene practices falls to the wayside for many young gents. With the stress of school and work, along with the lack of structure they once had at home, it’s easy to let yourself go.</p>\n<p>This post is just a friendly reminder to keep up those regular grooming habits you hopefully formed in your youth. If you haven’t developed these habits yet, now is a good time to start. You’ll feel more alert, have more confidence, and won’t repel the ladies. As an added bonus, maintaining good bodily hygiene can help you become a man of character like Benjamin Franklin: <a href=\"http://artofmanliness.com/2008/05/04/the-virtuous-life-cleanliness/\">cleanliness was one of his 13 virtues</a>.</p>\n<p>Let me be clear. I’m in no way suggesting you become overly fastidious about your personal grooming and hygiene. That sort of preening isn’t attractive in a man, and you probably have better things to be doing than standing in the mirror worrying about blemishes. All I’m encouraging is keeping up with the basic stuff you learned in elementary school health class that will keep you smelling fresh and looking presentable.</p>\n<p><strong>Brush and floss every day, morning and night. </strong>This was the first habit that I let slip when I went away from home the first time. Between waking up late for class and staying up late into the evening playing video games, my morning and evening dental care became pretty irregular. But I paid for my negligence by having to get two cavities filled at the end of the semester. What a preventable waste of money.</p>\n<p>Invest three minutes of your day, morning and night, into proper dental hygiene. Brush twice a day, floss once. Even if you’re dog tired and ready to go to bed, make the effort to get it done. Include a tongue scraping in your routine, too. That really helps in decreasing bad breath. Taking care of your oral hygiene is a habit that will save you money in the long run and increase the chances for that kiss at the end of a date.</p>\n<p><strong>Shower regularly. </strong>You’ll have that occasional string of days when you’re so busy that you don’t have time to shower. But don’t let your shower-less-ness go on for more than three days. If you get a job in a restaurant, it’s important to shower after every shift, unless of course you’re dating someone who enjoys nuzzling a man who smells like refried beans.</p>\n<div style=\"width:410px\"><img title=\"whisper-bo\" src=\"http://content.artofmanliness.com/uploads//2012/08/whisper-bo.jpeg\" alt=\"\" width=\"400\" height=\"1004\"><p>Don’t be this guy. Take a shower.</p></div>\n<p>I’ve had several young folks ask me  if there’s some sort of special “manly” soap or shampoo they should use. <a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00028LN1K/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=B00028LN1K&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;tag=stucosuccess-20\">Grandpa’s Pine Tar Soap</a> is a favorite of mine. You can find it at most health food stores. You can use it on both your skin and hair, it’s supposed to help with everything from psoriasis to dandruff, and it leaves you smelling like a basement in Vermont…in the best possible way. But really, your soap choice doesn’t matter, even though there’s a bunch of new marketing and “men’s-only” soaps and shampoos telling you otherwise. Get the giant econo pack of Irish Spring and you’re good to go. If you have very sensitive or acne-prone skin, get a special facial soap for those needs.</p>\n<p><strong>Go easy on the cologne.</strong> Body sprays are heavily marketed to young men as a foolproof way to attract the ladies, leading some guys to go overboard with enveloping themselves in a cloud of it before going out. Instead, apply just a couple of dabs or sprays of cologne to areas like your neck or the insides of your wrists if you want to wear a fragrance. For a young man on a budget, colognes need not be any more expensive than body sprays — <a href=\"http://artofmanliness.com/2012/01/10/6-forgotten-drugstore-colognes-and-aftershaves/\">there are many drugstore varieties that only cost a few bucks and have very appealing and masculine scents.</a></p>\n<p><strong>Make friends with Gold Bond Powder. </strong>Nothing keeps away the swamp crotch and stinky feet like Gold Bond Powder. If you live in hot, humid climates, Gold Bond is a must. Just sprinkle some on your junk and in your shoes. You’ll stay cool and dry all day long.</p>\n<p><strong>Keep your nails trimmed. </strong>Unless you’re a flamenco guitarist or going for a Guinness World Record, keep your fingernails trimmed. Don’t chew them; gnawed up nails are not attractive and give some people the heebie-jeebies. Get a simple nail clipper and give your nails a quick trim once a week before you hop into the shower. Follow the natural curve of your finger as you cut, leaving the thin, white, unattached crescent of the nail about as wide as a dime. Just enough to still scratch your head.</p>\n<p>It’s important to keep your toenails trimmed, too, especially since flips-flops are incredibly popular footwear for young men. You don’t want to look like a sloth, and scrape your woman’s legs with your claws when you’re canoodling. But don’t go overboard with the toenail trimming. Excessive trimming can lead to ingrown toenails. Cut straight across the nail and leave them a little a long. Toenails that are cut too short are prone to burrowing back into your flesh.</p>\n<p>Whether you’re trimming your fingernails or toenails, be sure to clean up afterwards — don’t leave your trimmings on the floor or countertop. If you’ve got dirt under your nails, scoop it out with the nail file that is probably attached to your clippers. And if you get a hangnail, carefully clip it off, rather than pulling at it and making it bleed.</p>\n<p><strong>Unless you have extended-wear contacts, take your contacts out every night. </strong>Sleeping with your contacts in several nights in a row makes you susceptible to corneal ulcers. I know a guy who got ‘em because he never took his contacts out. Even with extended-wear contacts, my optometrist told me it’s still not a good idea to wear them to sleep in for more than a few nights in a row.</p>\n<p><strong>Shave regularly/keep facial hair groomed. </strong>College is a time when many young men start experimenting with facial hair. Nothing wrong with that at all. But whether you go with a <a title=\"Growing a Manly Beard\" href=\"http://artofmanliness.com/2008/11/28/growing-a-manly-beard/\">full-on beard</a> or a <a title=\"The Art of Manliness Mustache Style Guide\" href=\"http://artofmanliness.com/2011/10/31/mustache-styles/\">distinguished mustache</a>, commit to it and keep it groomed. Don’t be one of those guys who grows a patchy neckbeard every two weeks because he’s too lazy to shave. Two days of scruff can be attractive. Two weeks of ungroomed, patchy neckbeard growth looks gross. If you’re going to go neckbeard, <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Henry_David_Thoreau\">do it right</a>.</p>\n<p>When it comes to shaving, if you’ve grown up using a cartridge razor, now’s a good time to experiment with <a href=\"http://artofmanliness.com/2008/01/04/how-to-shave-like-your-grandpa/\">using a safety razor and making shaving more of an enjoyable ritual in your life.</a></p>\n<p><strong>Keep your hair trimmed.</strong> Just as in facial hair, college is a time where guys both experiment with growing their hair out and get kind of lazy with taking care of it. Letting your hair get a little shaggy is a normal part of the college experience. But don’t let it get totally out of hand; it’s time for a trim when it becomes a distraction to you. I didn’t get my hair cut at all my first semester, and my hair, which is naturally quite thick and ample, became a giant, unattractive bowl that made me feel nappy and disheveled. When your hair is getting in your eyes and stuff, it’s time for a haircut. What, what’s that you say? Some young men purposefully grow out Bieber-esque bangs that they swing from side to side and push out of their eyes every few minutes? Why would a man want to mess with his hair that much? What’s that you say? I sound like an old man? Yes, yes I do.</p>\n<p>By the way, just as now is a good time to try shaving with a safety razor, if you’ve only gotten your haircut at Supercuts growing up, now’s a good time <a href=\"http://artofmanliness.com/2008/05/20/rediscovering-the-barbershop/\">to start taking part in the manly ritual of visiting a local barbershop</a>. Get some friends together and go try it. <a href=\"http://artofmanliness.com/2009/08/18/how-to-pick-a-barber/\">Here’s a guide on how to pick a good barber.</a></p>\n<p><strong>Treat your acne.</strong> Having acne can make you feel really self-conscious and sap your self-confidence. But in this day and age, it’s easily treatable in the vast majority of cases, and there’s absolutely no need to suffer through it. If you’ve got a mild case, wash your face morning and night with a face wash made for acne-prone skin and spot treat pimples with a benzoyl peroxide cream when they pop up. If that dries out your skin, use a face wash for acne-prone skin once a day, and a gentle cleanser like Cetaphil once a day. If you get more than an occasional pimple, you might be tempted to try something like Proactiv, but there are much cheaper alternatives out there. Proactiv basically consists of a face wash and topical treatment in which the active ingredient is benzoyl peroxide. But you can buy generic benzoyl peroxide face washes and creams separately at the drugstore for a fraction of the cost. Try that first. Keep in mind that benzoyl peroxide can bleach your clothes and pillowcase, so wash the cream off your fingers after you apply it, and don’t put it on during the day, as it can sweat into the collar of your colored shirt. Use a white pillow case at home, and remember this when you visit someone!</p>\n<p>It can also help to get a short haircut that keeps the hair off your face and skin (see, not just an old man thing– there are truly practical reasons for keeping it short!) and to wash your pillowcase regularly.</p>\n<p>If your acne doesn’t clear up, don’t hesitate to visit your doctor, as they can prescribe antibiotics and topical treatments that can clear up your face entirely.</p>\n<p>Finally, if you’ve got bacne, <a title=\"Battling Bacne\" href=\"http://artofmanliness.com/2009/10/21/battling-bacne/\">here’s a post about how to deal with it.</a></p>\n<div style=\"width:410px\"><img title=\"hands\" src=\"http://content.artofmanliness.com/uploads//2012/08/hands.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"400\" height=\"502\"><p>Don’t mind me. Just washing my man hands here.</p></div>\n<p><strong>Wash your hands.</strong> A 2005 survey at ballparks indicated that 37 percent of men didn’t wash their hands after using the restroom. Gross. If you want to stay healthy, especially during cold and flu season, wash your hands regularly. I always disregarded this injunction too, until one semester in college I came down with a flu that left me with it coming out of both ends, and stuck shivering and feverish in bed for several days; I couldn’t do anything fun, or workout, or study, even though I really needed to. It sucked big time and wasted a week of my life. After that experience, I became better at hand-washing.</p>\n<p>On a related note…get a flu shot every year. If you’re a student, your school might offer them for free at the student health center, otherwise you can get them for $25 at Walgreens. It’s one of the best investments you can make…you can’t put a price on a whole week of your life.</p>\n<p><em><strong>Any other hygiene reminders or advice for a young man heading out on his own?

Because of the ease at which you can deposit and withdraw from a checking account, it will likely be the hub of all your financial activity.</p>\n<p>Below we provide important tips and considerations on opening your first checking account. (While you’re at it, open up a savings account too <a title=\"Why and How to Start an Emergency Fund\" href=\"http://artofmanliness.com/2011/03/23/why-and-how-to-start-an-emergency-fund/\">for your emergency fund</a>.) For those of you who already have a checking account, we also provide some friendly reminders on managing it wisely.</p>\n<h3><strong>What to Look for in a Checking Account</strong></h3>\n<p>Not all checking accounts are created equal. Some banks offer higher than average interest rates, while others offer accounts with no interest; some banks charge a monthly fee to keep your money with them, while others offer free checking accounts. Below we highlight a few things to consider when selecting and applying for a checking account:</p>\n<p><strong>Look for free checking accounts, but understand that a free checking account isn’t really “free.”</strong>  A free checking account is an account that doesn’t charge you a monthly service fee to keep your money in that account. Many banks used to offer free checking accounts without any strings attached, but those days are largely over. These days, most banks won’t charge you a monthly fee <em>so long as you meet certain conditions</em>. Usually the conditions are that you make a certain amount of direct deposits and debit card transactions each month, or you maintain a certain minimum balance.</p>\n<p>If you fail to meet those requirements, the monthly service fee is around $5 at most banks.</p>\n<p><strong>Look for accounts with no minimum balance.  </strong>When you’re young and just starting out in life, your cash flow is likely minuscule. When I was in college, it was common for my checking account to dip below $100 despite my best efforts at budgeting. If you have a bank account that requires a minimum balance and you dip below that number, you’re going to be slapped with a penalty. Many free checking accounts have no minimum balance requirement (but require you to make direct deposits or debit card transactions to keep the account free), so select one of those.</p>\n<p>Avoid checking accounts that offer higher than normal interest rates. They look enticing, but they usually require a minimum balance of a few thousand dollars.</p>\n<p><strong>Look for accounts with online access. </strong>You want to keep on top of how much money is coming in and going out of your checking account. It used to be you had to religiously keep track of every single one of your transactions in a check register if you wanted to know how much you had in your account. Today most banks offer free online services that let you check your account online. Get one that does. Also check if your bank allows you to hook up your accounts with services like <a href=\"http://mint.com\">Mint</a>, <a href=\"http://www.youneedabudget.com/\">YouNeedaBudget</a>, or <a href=\"http://quicken.intuit.com/\">Quicken</a>. Keeping track of your checkbook on your computer is much easier than using the old pocket register.</p>\n<p><strong>Ask how check “holds” are handled. </strong>Let’s say you get a big fat $2,000 from Grandpa to help pay for school. You deposit it in your account. You’re ready to drop a $2,000 money bomb at the bursar’s office the next day, right? Nope.</p>\n<p>Banks usually place “holds” on checks from other banks, especially out-of-state banks, for a few days to ensure the check or electronic deposit will be honored by the issuing bank. During this hold period, you won’t have access to the money you deposited. For checks from local sources, the hold period is usually two days; for out-of-state check sources, the hold period can be up to five days.</p>\n<p>It’s good to know your bank’s policy so you don’t spend money that you don’t have access to yet.</p>\n<p><strong>Get an account with a check/debit card. </strong>Most banks offer customers a debit card when they open up an account. Debit cards offer the convenience of credit cards, without the crippling high interest rates. Whenever you swipe a check card, your checking account is deducted.</p>\n<blockquote style=\"border:0px;background-color:#ffffff\"><p><span style=\"color:#ff0000\"><strong>What’s the Difference Between Choosing Credit or Debit on Check Card Readers?</strong></span></p>\n<p>Whenever you swipe your check card at a store, you’ll often be asked to select “credit or debit.” While both options will result in money being deducted from your checking account, they each process the transaction differently.</p>\n<p>If you select “credit” and your check card happens to be a Visa checking card, your transaction is verified with your signature (sometimes), and will be processed through Visa’s networks. The benefit to you for using your debit card as credit is that you get to take advantage of Visa’s added security options to prevent against fraudulent transactions. You can also earn reward points with certain cards. Store owners have to pay Visa a pretty hefty service fee (usually 2% of the transaction) every time you choose credit, which is why, you may have recently noticed the check card readers at your favorite store bring up debit as the default option, forcing you to press the cancel button, and select credit instead.</p>\n<p>If you select “debit,” you’ll need to enter your four digit PIN. After you enter it, your transaction will be processed through an electronic funds transfer, and funds are taken from your account instantly. You don’t get the same protections on your purchase as you do when you select credit and debit transactions aren’t eligible for reward programs. You can, however, ask for cash back when you make a purchase using debit. That means if your purchase was $5, you can have the store debit your card for $25, and the store will give you $20 straight from the till. That comes in handy when you need cash, but don’t want to pay an ATM fee. Be aware that store owners, especially mom and pop places, prefer debit transactions because of the reduced service cost.</p></blockquote>\n<p><strong>Look for a bank with plenty of ATMs in the area and ask about ATM fees. </strong>You’ll have those days when you need quick access to cash. That’s where ATMs will come in handy. But the convenience of ATMs come at a price.  While most banks offer machines that don’t charge withdrawal fees for their own customers, banks will charge you a fee for using a competitor’s ATM. When you add that fee, to the fee, or surcharge, the competitor’s bank charges you to use their ATM, you’re looking at paying about $5 just to get your cash.</p>\n<blockquote style=\"border:0px;background-color:#ffffff\"><p><span style=\"color:#ff0000\"><strong>Should I Go With an Online-Only Bank?</strong></span></p>\n<p>In the past few years, the number of online-only banks has increased dramatically. Because they have less overhead than brick and mortar banks, online banks are able to provide higher interest rates and charge fewer fees. A few years ago, online banks like <a href=\"http://ingdirect.com/\">ING Direct</a> and <a href=\"http://ally.com/\">Ally</a> had crazy monthly interest rates between 2%-4%, but they’ve since gone down to about 0.8-1%. Not fantastic, but still better than most traditional banks.</p>\n<p>While checking accounts from online banks provide higher interest rates than traditional banks, I’d still open your first checking account with a traditional bank. Here’s why.</p>\n<p><strong>Things take longer to clear with online accounts.</strong> The internet is supposed to make things faster. Online banks didn’t get the memo. Checks and even electronic deposits, however big or small, take forever to clear online banks. For example, when I make transfers from my main checking account to my emergency fund that I keep in an online ING checking account, it takes about three days before I have access to that money. For large deposits or transfers, the wait is longer. Not good if you need money to clear fast.</p>\n<p><strong>You can’t easily deposit paper checks or cash with online accounts. </strong>If you ever get a check or cash for your birthday from Aunt Gertrude, depositing that money into your online banking account can be tricky. Most online banks require all your transactions to be electronic. But there are some that allow you to mail the check or cash in. Even if you can mail the paper check, it will be a while before you have access to that money — you have to wait for the check to arrive at the online bank’s headquarters, and then you have to wait another couple of days before the check clears.</p>\n<p>However, some online banks are beginning to provide services that allow you to deposit a check from anywhere by simply snapping a photo of the check with your smartphone, so this is changing.</p>\n<p>Many online banks also don’t provide wire services or cashier’s checks. That can get you into trouble when you’re buying a car or a home (or posting bond to get someone out of jail!), as those transactions often require a cashier’s check. If all your money is in an online bank on closing day, you’re sunk.</p>\n<p><strong>You get better service with traditional banks.</strong> The only customer service you get with online banks comes by phone or email, but there are some issues that are more easily done face-t0-face with a teller. Traditional banks also typically have a network of fee-free ATMs in your area; not so with online banks.</p></blockquote>\n<h3><strong>What You’ll Need to Open a Checking Account</strong></h3>\n<div style=\"width:510px\"><img title=\"banking\" src=\"http://content.artofmanliness.com/uploads//2012/08/banking.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"500\" height=\"360\"><p>Wipe that smile off your face. Haven’t you ever seen a 50 year old grown man apply for his first checking account before?</p></div>\n<p>Opening a checking account is a breeze. Just walk into the bank and inform the teller that you’d like to open an account. All you have to do is fill out a short application, show the teller your photo ID, and deposit some money to open up an account. The amount you have to initially deposit will vary from bank to bank — some require only $1, while others ask for $50, $100, or even $250.</p>\n<p>Some banks even let you open up an account online, but you’ll have to have an account at another institution that you can use to fund your new account.</p>\n<h3>How to Write a Check</h3>\n<p>Because we don’t typically write checks every day, when it comes time to do so, it’s easy to mess up. Here’s how you do it:</p>\n<div style=\"width:510px\"><img title=\"check\" src=\"http://content.artofmanliness.com/uploads//2012/08/check1.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"500\" height=\"239\"><p>1) Always date your checks. 2) Write the name of the person or business you’re paying next to “Pay to the order of.” 3) Write the amount of the check in numeric format. You should start as far over to the left as possible. This prevents anybody from slipping in an extra number or two. 4) Write out the amount of the check in words. For the cents part, use a fraction with 100 as the denominator. In this example since it was $500 even, I wrote out “00/100.” 5) Sign the check. 6) It’s a good idea to write a short note on what the check was for. It helps with accounting.</p></div>\n<h3><strong>Managing Your Checking Account</strong></h3>\n<p>Now that you have a checking account, it’s important that you manage it effectively. If you don’t keep on top of the money coming and going from your account, you risk the embarrassment and financial penalties that come from spending money you don’t have.</p>\n<p><strong>Opt-out of overdraft protection. </strong>Overdraft protection means that if you make a purchase with your debit card, and you don’t have enough money in your account to complete the transaction, the bank will “loan” you the money…and charge you a $25-$35 fee for their “generosity.” But that’s a big price to pay to avoid the embarrassment or inconvenience of having your card declined or a check bounce. And these fees can add up fast, because here’s what many consumers don’t know: most banks will purposefully <em>process your largest transactions first</em>, and then your smaller transactions after that. So let’s say you have $285 in your checking account, and you buy a coffee for $3.50 in the morning, a sandwich for $5 at noon, and then some college textbooks in the afternoon for $300. The banks will process the $300 transaction <em>first</em>, even though it was made later in the day, thus depleting your account, and then charge you a $35 overdraft fee for the textbooks, another $35 fee for the sandwich and another $35 for the coffee, and bill you for $105 in total overdraft fees. Ouch!</p>\n<p>Banks used to automatically enroll their customers in overdraft protection programs, but a court ruling in 2010 made that illegal. You can and should opt out of overdraft protection. But because overdraft fees were a big moneymaker for banks, they still aggressively try to get you to sign up. Every time I check my bank account online, I get a pop-up that asks if I’m sure I don’t want to enroll in their overdraft protection program. You just have to say no and keep saying no.</p>\n<p><strong>Check your account weekly. </strong>Make a habit of checking your account online every week. Not only does this keep you abreast of how much you have in your account so you don’t overspend, it gives you a chance to check for errors or fraudulent transactions. If you notice any errors or possible fraudulent transactions, notify your bank immediately.</p>\n<p>Also, sometimes when you have something set up on autopay, like a gym membership or Netflix, that makes a withdrawal from your checking account every month, even when you cancel the service, they can “forget” to stop charging your account. Be on the lookout for this.</p>\n<p><strong>Understand that the balance your bank statement says you have could actually be more than you really have. </strong>This is something that trips up a lot of young people when they first get a checking account. Your bank says you have $750 in your checking account, so you pay your $500 rent. A few days later you get notice from your bank that you’re being charged an overdraft fee and you have an account balance of -$50.  What happened?</p>\n<p>Well, a week earlier you wrote a check for $300 for tuition, but it still hadn’t cleared when you checked your checking account. After you sent a check to your landlord, the tuition check finally cleared, leaving you in the hole and facing a stiff overdraft fee.</p>\n<p>Because of the delay between the moment the transaction occurs and when it actually posts, it’s important to track all your debit card transactions, ATM withdrawals, and checks written in a check register (You can use the old fashioned paper registers or a digital one like Quicken, YouNeedABudget, or Mint. I know some folks who use a simple Excel spreadsheet ). A check register lets you know how much you <em>really </em>have available in your account. Don’t think you can mentally keep track of it. At some point you’ll experience a brain fart. I know from experience.</p>\n<p><strong>Set-up online alerts for when your balance reaches a certain level. </strong>To play it safe, establish a base amount for your checking account that you’ll never go under. That small amount acts like a firewall for bounced checks. Take it a step further by setting up an alert with your bank’s online system that will notify you whenever your checking account balance gets within $50 of your minimum balance. Once you get the alert, cut back on spending and deposit some money.</p>\n<p><strong>Use direct deposit for your paychecks and pay bills online. </strong>Whenever you land a job, ask your employer to automatically deposit your paychecks into your checking account. You’ll have to sign a form and provide a voided check to get auto-deposits set up. Where available, pay as many of your bills online as you can and make them automatic. We’ll be talking more about that later this month.</p>\n<p><strong>Balance your checkbook monthly. </strong>You’ve probably seen your parents balance their checkbooks. Balancing a checkbook simply means reconciling the balance your bank says you have in your account with the balance you have in your records. Remember, with the delays between checks clearing, those numbers can be off.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align:center\"><img title=\"balance\" src=\"http://content.artofmanliness.com/uploads//2012/08/balance.jpeg\" alt=\"\" width=\"319\" height=\"421\"></p>\n<p>People are divided on whether you need to balance a checkbook in our world of digital finances. But even with the speed of digital transactions, things can get off kilter in your account, so it’s not a bad idea to reconcile your account at least once a month. Money software like Quicken and YouNeedaBudget make this process a breeze. They’ll automatically reconcile your accounts with a click of a button. Sometimes, though, you’ll need to bust out the old pen and paper to do some figurin’. If that’s the case, <a href=\"http://www.mint.com/blog/how-to/how-to-balance-a-checkbook-012012-2/\">follow these instructions from the fine folks at Mint.com.</a></p>\n<p><em><strong>Any other tips and advice for a young man opening his first bank account?

It’s not exactly rocket science (none of these 31 <em>basic</em> life skills will be, so let’s retire that caveat today), but there is a surprising amount to it — believe or not, whole books have been written on the subject! Today we’ll cover the essential basics in an easy-to-follow question and answer format. It’s an important skill to learn not just because everybody has to do it every single week without fail, but when you know how to do it properly, you won’t ruin your clothes or wear them out too quickly — something a young man on a budget can ill-afford to do.  So let’s get started.</p>\n<h3><span style=\"text-decoration:underline\"><strong>Before You Wash Your Clothes</strong></span></h3>\n<h3><strong><span style=\"color:#ff0000\">How Often Do I Need to Wash Things?</span> </strong></h3>\n<p>You don’t have to wash everything you own after only one use. The less you wash your clothes, the longer they’ll last. While a lot depends on how often you shower/how smelly/sweaty you are/how long you wear the garment/the weather, and you can generally gauge whether something needs washing by how it feels and smells, here’s a breakdown of how often on average to wash what:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Undershirts/underwear/socks</strong> <strong>– 1 wear.</strong> So have plenty of pairs. Don’t turn your underwear inside-out for another use! But if you run out, and don’t have time for a wash, wash a pair in the sink at night and let it dry for the morning.</li>\n<li><strong>T-shirts — 1 wear.</strong> They absorb a lot of oil and sweat.</li>\n<li><strong>Jeans — every 4-6 wears.</strong> Yes, it is possible to go many months without washing your denim (a must if it’s selvedge denim), and if they don’t smell, go right ahead; <a href=\"http://shine.yahoo.com/fashion/student-wears-jeans-for-15-months-proves-they-have-no-more-germs-than-after-13-days-2444364.html\">they won’t accumulate any more bacteria after 300 wears than 15</a>. You can spot-clean any stains you get (this goes for other clothing too).</li>\n<li><strong>Khaki/cargo shorts and pants — every 2-4 wears.</strong> Khakis don’t hide dirt as well as jeans and absorb more bodily sweat and oil.</li>\n<li><strong>Button-down shirts and sweaters — 1-3 wears.</strong> Very dependent on how tightly the garment fits to the body, the weather, and how long you wore it. When you take it off, give the armpits a sniff. If they don’t smell, put the shirt back on the hanger or drape the sweater over a chair to air out. If it’s right on the border, try a shot of Febreeze.</li>\n<li><strong>Pajamas — 2-3 wears.</strong> Depending on how much you sweat at night (although everybody sweats more while sleeping than they realize — around a liter a night)</li>\n<li><strong>Towels — once a week</strong> (given daily use).</li>\n<li><strong>Bed sheets — every two weeks.</strong> Experts say to wash bed sheets every week ideally, but I know most young men aren’t going to do that. But at least wash them every couple of weeks (if you can’t even manage that, at least wash your pillowcase–especially if you have acne-prone skin). If you need motivation, think of lying around in skin cells, dust mites and their feces, fungal mold and spores, bodily secretions, and bacteria. Not to mention insect parts, pollen, and soil. Sweet dreams.</li>\n</ul>\n<h3><strong><span style=\"color:#ff0000\">How Do I Know How to Wash Something?</span></strong></h3>\n<p><strong>READ THE LABEL.</strong> If you get anything from this post, let it be this. <strong>Read the darn label.</strong> It will tell you exactly how to wash, dry, and iron your clothes. Don’t worry. You don’t need to know the meaning of those crazy laundry symbols you may have seen on your dad’s 1980s polo shirt. Clothing manufacturers used to rely on them to tell consumers how to wash a piece of clothing. Today most clothing companies forego the symbols and literally spell out how you’re supposed to wash their clothes. For example, my polo shirt from Criquet Shirts has the following washing instructions: “Machine wash cold. Wash with like colors. Non-chlorine bleach only. Tumble dry low. Warm iron as needed.”  I checked my other shirts, and all the labels were similiar: instructions all spelled out; no symbols.</p>\n<p>If a piece of clothing says “Dry Clean Only,” then <a title=\"A Man’s Guide to Dry Cleaning\" href=\"http://artofmanliness.com/2009/11/05/dry_cleaning_guide/\">take it to the cleaners</a>. Yes, there are ways you can launder dry clean-only fabrics at home, but for a beginner it’s not worth the risk, and for a young man, probably not worth the hassle. (If you’re a low-maintenance guy who’s never going to want to get something dry-cleaned, be sure to check the label before you buy something.)</p>\n<h3><span style=\"color:#ff0000\"><strong>How Do I Sort My Clothing Into Loads?</strong></span></h3>\n<p>There are all kinds of elaborate laundry sorting systems out there, but for most young, college-aged men they’re overkill. Here’s the system I used during my bachelor years.</p>\n<p>First, sort your dirty laundry by color. Many experts recommend creating three different color piles: whites, lights, and darks. In my experience, you just need two: <strong>whites and colors</strong>. Sorting by color ensures that your white dress shirts don’t turn pink from the bleeding crimson from your OU Sooners t-shirt (don’t ask).</p>\n<p><strong>After sorting by color, sort each pile by fabric heft: lighter fabrics (like dress shirts) in one pile and heavier fabrics (like jeans and sweatshirts) in another pile.</strong> <strong>I also create a pile that consists of bed linens and towels</strong>. Sorting by fabric type becomes important when we dry our laundry. Lighter items, like your t-shirts, dry much more quickly than your heavier items, like towels. When you dry light fabrics with other light fabrics, you can reduce the amount of time the dry cycle takes, which saves you money. This doesn’t necessarily mean you’ll need to do more loads either; heavier items, like jeans and sweatshirts, don’t need to be washed as often as other stuff, so just “save up” until you have one big heavy item load to do.</p>\n<h3><span style=\"color:#ff0000\"><strong>What Do I Do About Stains?</strong></span></h3>\n<p><span style=\"color:#000000\">While the nitty-gritty of stain removal is not within the purview of this post, many stains will come out in the wash if you simply<strong> pre-treat them with something like Shout.</strong> So when you sort through your clothes, be on the lookout for stains.<br>\n</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"color:#000000\">If you have white dress shirts or light-colored t-shirts in your dirty laundry, make sure to pre-treat your collar and your armpits with stain remover. You don’t want that dreaded ring around your collar or yellow armpit stains. <a title=\"How to Remove and Prevent Yellow Armpit Stains\" href=\"http://artofmanliness.com/2012/04/03/how-to-remove-yellow-armpit-stains/\"><span style=\"color:#000000\">If you do get yellow armpit stains, here’s how to get rid of them.</span></a></span></p>\n<h3><span style=\"text-decoration:underline\"><strong>Washing Your Clothes</strong></span></h3>\n<p><img title=\"manlaundry\" src=\"http://content.artofmanliness.com/uploads//2012/08/manlaundry.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"435\" height=\"473\"></p>\n<h3><strong><span style=\"color:#ff0000\">What Water Temperature Should I Use?</span></strong></h3>\n<p>This can get confusing, but keep it simple<strong>: Use warm water for whites; cold water for colors. </strong>Now admittedly I used to be a hot water for whites guy, but after researching the heck out of this article, I found that most experts agree that with the efficiency of washers and detergents these days, using only warm, or even cold water for all washes is a-okay. You might still want to wash your linens, towels, and gym clothes (regardless of their color) in hot water though, since hot water is best at getting out the grime. But always cold for colors, as it fades the color of clothes less than hot water does.</p>\n<h3><span style=\"color:#ff0000\"><strong>What Cycle Should I Choose?</strong></span></h3>\n<p><strong>Your default cycle should be “regular.” </strong>It’s the longest cycle and has the fastest and most vigorous wash and spin cycles (spin cycles are when the machine spins out the water from the clothes). It’s good for all fabric types.</p>\n<p>Unless you have the same underclothing tastes as J. Edgar Hoover, you won’t use the delicate cycle very often, except for things like sweaters or a nice dress shirt. Remember: read the label.</p>\n<p>What about the ever mysterious permanent press cycle? This cycle is for synthetic fabrics like rayon, polyester, and acetate as well as natural fabrics that have been treated with a chemical to resist wrinkles (like your “no-iron” dress shirts). The permanent press cycle has a fast wash cycle and a slow spin cycle. The slow spin cycle keeps some of the water in the clothes, which helps prevent wrinkling. The only clothing I can imagine a young man having in his wardrobe that would require permanent press would maybe be a rayon vintage bowling shirt. Other than that, I think you’re safe to use the regular cycle for most of your washing needs.</p>\n<h3><span style=\"color:#ff0000\"><strong>What Load Size Should I Choose?</strong></span></h3>\n<p><strong></strong>Sometimes you have a crap load of clothes to clean, and other times you may have just a few items. Different amounts of water are required for each situation. The usual load option sizes are small, medium, large, and extra-large. What constitutes a small, medium, large, or extra-large load?</p>\n<p>A typical top-loading machine uses the following scale for judging load size:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Small:</strong> clothing fills 1/3 of wash drum before adding water</li>\n<li><strong>Medium:</strong> clothing fills 1/3 to 1/2 of wash drum before adding water</li>\n<li><strong>Large:</strong> clothing fills 1/2 to 3/4 of wash drum before adding water</li>\n<li><strong>Extra-large:</strong> clothing fills wash drum 3/4 to completely full before adding water</li>\n</ul>\n<h3><span style=\"color:#ff0000\"><strong>What Kind of Detergent Should I Use? Powder, Liquid, HE?<br>\n</strong></span></h3>\n<p>Consumerism, for better or for worse, has given us dozens of different kinds of laundry detergents to choose from. So many, in fact, that it can be overwhelming to pick which one to use. While all of them will clean your clothes, each detergent type has pros and cons.</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Powder detergents</strong> — cheaper per load than liquid detergents and better at getting out stains like dirt and clay than their liquid cousins. Unless specially formulated, powder detergents don’t readily dissolve in cold water like liquid ones.</li>\n<li><strong>Liquid detergents</strong> — more expensive, but better at getting out organic stains like blood, grass, and pizza sauce. They also dissolve better in cold water.</li>\n<li><strong>HE detergents </strong>– more expensive than regular detergents because they are specifically designed for High Efficiency washers. They are low-sudsing and quick dispersing for use in low water volume machines. If you’re living in the dorms or in apartments with shared laundry facilities, you won’t likely have HE washing machines. While you can use HE detergent in regular washing machines, it would be a waste of money to do so.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Detergent companies are now marketing small pods that contain both liquid and powder detergent and dissolve in the wash. While certainly convenient, they’re expensive. For a young man on a budget, this probably isn’t a good option. Go with the powder. The ambitious young man on a budget can even try his hand at <a href=\"http://tipnut.com/10-homemade-laundry-soap-detergent-recipes/\">making his own detergent.</a></p>\n<p>Also here’s another money-saving tip about laundry detergent. <strong>Experts say you can get away with<a href=\"http://lifehacker.com/5833434/save-money-by-using-just-half-the-laundry-detergent-recommended\"> using anywhere from 1/2 to 1/8 what the manufacturer recommends</a></strong> and still come away with clean clothes. I aim for about half the recommended fill line myself.</p>\n<p>In addition to choosing between liquid, powder, and pods, you can select scented or unscented detergents. If you’re prone to allergies, go with the unscented version.</p>\n<p>Finally,<strong> fill the washing machine with water and add detergent before you add your clothes.</strong> While the machine is filling with water, add your detergent. By filling your washing machine with water and detergent before you add your clothes, you ensure that your detergent is evenly distributed throughout the water. Also, pouring detergent right on your clothing can leave spots; this is especially a concern with powder detergents.</p>\n<h3><span style=\"color:#ff0000\"><strong>Should I Use Bleach?</strong></span></h3>\n<p><strong></strong>Bleaching, if done improperly, will ruin your clothing. But in the hands of a knowledgeable person, bleach can remove stains, make whites whiter, and disinfect the nasty bedsheets you’ve been lying in sick all week.  <strong>But if you’re not comfortable with using bleach, you can honestly get away with skipping it.</strong> I didn’t use it all that often and my clothes looked fine. Kate’s never used it in her life. But if you decide to use it, here are some guidelines.</p>\n<p>There are two types of bleaches: chlorine and non-chlorine bleaches. Chlorine bleach is the strongest, but it’s not safe for all fabrics. It’s the bleach that can leave your classic, green polo looking like a groovy tie-dyed shirt if you get some splashed on it.</p>\n<p>Non-chlorine bleach, like OxiClean, is safe for colored clothing made with colorfast dyes and fabrics and will make colored clothing look brighter. Non-chlorine bleach, however, isn’t as effective as chlorine bleach at brightening whites.</p>\n<p>If you decide to use chlorine bleach on your whites or bed linens, pour the instructed amount in the bleach dispenser in the washing machine before starting the cycle. If your machine doesn’t have a liquid bleach dispenser, mix the bleach with 1 to 1 1/2 quarts of water and add it after your clothes have been washing for five minutes. Stir it in with a wooden stick or spoon.</p>\n<p><strong>Never pour bleach directly on clothing, even whites.</strong> I had to learn this from experience. I poured some bleach on a load of white laundry while the machine was still filling with water. After drying, my white clothes had a bunch of brown stains which I later learned were chemical burns from the bleach. Lesson: use bleach with caution.</p>\n<h3><strong>Washing Tips</strong></h3>\n<p><strong>Load your clothing a few pieces at a time. </strong>With the machine filled with water and your detergent added, you’re now ready to add clothing. Don’t throw giant, wadded up armfuls of laundry into the machine. Add your clothing a few pieces at a time. This will ensure that all parts of the fabric get adequate agitation in the machine.</p>\n<p><strong>Don’t cram all your clothing into a single load. </strong>In an effort to save time and money, you will be tempted to cram as much of your dirty laundry into a single wash load as possible. Resist that temptation. Your clothes need room in the drum to swish around in order to get clean. <em>If you want clean clothes, don’t overload the washing machine.</em></p>\n<p><strong>Close the lid and set a timer. </strong>To get the machine to start washing, simply close the lid. Because it’s easy to forget you have a load of laundry in the wash, set a timer on your smartphone to remind yourself to check the wash when the machine says it should be done. Nobody likes that rank smell that develops from leaving wet clothes in an empty washing machine for too long (although a toss in a hot cycle on the dryer can often zap the smell if that happens to you).</p>\n<h3><strong><span style=\"text-decoration:underline\">Drying Your Clothes</span></strong></h3>\n<p><img title=\"laundry1\" src=\"http://content.artofmanliness.com/uploads//2012/08/laundry1.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"400\" height=\"524\"></p>\n<p><strong>Not everything goes in the dryer.</strong> Remember: read the label. Some garments will say things like “Lay flat to dry.” In that case, spread it out flat on a towel, smoothing out the wrinkles. If it doesn’t go in the dryer, but doesn’t need to be laid flat, you can drape it over a drying rack or a chair. Even if a garment can technically go in the dryer, if you don’t want it to shrink — perhaps it was just the right size when you bought it or the freshman fifteen is making your jeans feel tight — go ahead and put it on the drying rack instead of the dryer. And of course, if you’re living in a house or apartment that allows line-drying, that’s a great option too: no shrinkage, less wear and tear on your clothes, no energy or quarter use, and that fresh air smell.</p>\n<p><strong>Clean out the lint screen.</strong> Before you put your wet clothes in the dryer, check the lint screen. A clean lint screen ensures that damp air leaves the machine and your clothes get dry. You may have to clean out the screen in the middle of a large load filled with items prone to shedding fuzzy stuff, i.e., towels, denim, etc. Oh, and make sure to save that lint! It’s a fantastic <a href=\"http://artofmanliness.com/2008/04/29/9-ways-to-start-a-fire-without-matches/\">fire-starter</a>.</p>\n<p><strong>Place clothing in dryer a few pieces at a time. </strong>Clothes tend to get lumped and knotted together in the wash. Throwing your wet clothes into the dryer in a giant ball will result in some clothes getting super dry and others remaining damp. To avoid this, grab a few items at a time from the washing machine, shake ‘em out if they’re tangled up, and then place them in the dryer.</p>\n<p><strong>Don’t cram the dryer. </strong>Just as you don’t want to cram all your clothes into a single wash cycle, you won’t want to cram all your clothes into a single drying cycle. Clothes need space in the dryer to tumble and get completely dry. You’ll save yourself time and money in the long run by breaking up your drying into smaller loads.</p>\n<p><strong>Throw in a fabric softener sheet. </strong>To avoid static cling and to give your clothes that soft, comforting feeling, throw in a fabric softener sheet. For smaller loads, you can use just half a sheet.</p>\n<p><strong>Select the correct drying temperature. </strong>Rule of thumb when it comes to drying temperatures: the hotter the drying temperature, the greater the likelihood of shrinking. If the care label on your garment says “Tumble Dry,” you can use the “regular” temp setting on your dryer. Regular is the hottest temperature and is suitable for sturdy cottons like towels, t-shirts, underwear, jeans, and sheets.</p>\n<p>The medium setting is suitable for permanent press clothing — synthetics and fabrics treated with wrinkle-free chems.</p>\n<p>Low is for stuff like knits and lingerie. Again, if you’re a man, you’ll likely have very little clothing that requires this setting.</p>\n<p><strong>Remove dried clothes immediately. </strong>To avoid wrinkles, remove your dry clothes from the dryer and fold and iron them immediately (we’ll be covering these skills later in the month). The longer you let them sit there, the more the wrinkles set.</p>\n<h3><strong><span style=\"text-decoration:underline\">Laundromat Protocol</span></strong></h3>\n<p>Many young men reading this will likely be washing their clothes in public laundromats and dormitory basements. Washing your clothes in shared machines requires pluck, craftiness, and social grace that you don’t need when washing your clothes in the privacy of your home. Below we provide some fast and not so hard rules to help you navigate the often strange world of laundromats:</p>\n<p><strong>Go on off days and off times.</strong>  “Saturday or Sunday is probably a good day to wash clothes. I’ve got nothing else going on.” You know what? That’s what everybody else in your dorm/apartment is thinking too. I remember attempting my first wash in the college dorm on a Saturday morning only to find it jam-packed. Tuesdays or Wednesdays are good days to go to the laundromat. If your schedule permits, go in the afternoon. If not, <a href=\"http://artofmanliness.com/2010/09/07/never-let-the-sun-catch-you-sleeping-why-and-how-to-become-an-early-riser/\">become an early-riser </a>and do your laundry first thing in the morning.</p>\n<p><strong>Grab plenty of quarters before leaving. </strong>Yes, some laundromats and dormitory facilities use credit card or student ID readers these days, but it’s a good way to put your change to use, and the change machines at laundromats that lack credit card machines are often broken.</p>\n<p><strong>Check washers and dryers before putting your clothes in. </strong>A leftover blue sock can turn your whitey-tighties into baby blue under-roos. Also, make sure to clean out the lint screen, but use a paper towel. You don’t want to touch the discarded pubes of complete strangers.</p>\n<p><strong>Use multiple machines when you can. </strong>One of the benefits of going to the laundromat on off days is that you’ll likely have access to multiple machines. So instead of washing and drying one load at a time, you can have multiple loads going at once, thus cutting your laundry time down significantly. Of course, you need to be courteous when using this technique. Don’t be the guy who hogs three machines when there’s a line of other people waiting for an open machine.</p>\n<p><strong>Be wary about leaving your laundry unattended.</strong> People steal laundry. Take that into consideration before leaving your laundry unattended. I know you’d probably prefer to be other places besides a laundromat, but I’d recommend hanging around until your clothes are finished. Get some work done while you’re waiting or read a book. Make use of that downtime. If you do decide to leave your laundry washing/drying unattended, be sure to set a timer on your phone so you come back right when the cycle is done; don’t make someone else take out your laundry and pile it on a table so they can use the machine.</p>\n<p><strong>Don’t forget your manners. </strong>Ask people to move their own laundry if you need space on the tables; nobody likes a strange man handling their intimates. On the same note, don’t take up too much space. You don’t need to sprawl all your clean clothes out on the table to fold them.</p>\n<p><em><strong>Got any more tips on doing your laundry?

It isn’t until you’re on your own that you realize how much you relied on adults to make your life run smoothly. From doing your laundry to calling the doctor when you’re sick, your parents likely did a lot of things for you.</p>\n<p>While you might not be completely self-sufficient right when you move out (many young people rely on their parents for varying degrees of financial support well into their twenties), you can certainly be self-reliant in a number of areas in your life. For example, you shouldn’t need your mom to remind you about important appointments or your dad to bug you about taking your car in to get its routine maintenance. You should be able to remember to do those things yourself. A man with a self-reliant mentality doesn’t wait around for someone else to take care of things that need to be taken care of. If he encounters a problem, he takes the initiative and tries to figure out how to resolve it himself.</p>\n<p>So how does a man develop a self-reliant mentality?</p>\n<p>One of the best answers I have found to this question actually comes from a great, albeit endearingly cheesy, 1950s educational film called “Developing Self-Reliance.” It’s ten minutes long and definitely worth watching:</p>\n<p><iframe src=\"http://reader.googleusercontent.com/reader/embediframe?src=http://www.youtube.com/v/xGROmq1mX1o?version%3D3%26hl%3Den_US&amp;width=500&amp;height=375\" width=\"500\" height=\"375\"></iframe></p>\n<p>In the film, a kind-hearted teacher lays out the four principles of building self-reliance for one of his young students:</p>\n<blockquote><p><img title=\"reliance2\" src=\"http://content.artofmanliness.com/uploads//2012/07/reliance2.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"500\" height=\"365\"></p></blockquote>\n<p><strong>1. Assume responsibility. </strong>Start taking responsibility for your life and the things in it. If you’ve relied on your mom to wake you up every morning so you weren’t late to school, it’s time to make friends with the alarm clock on your smartphone. Start using a calendar to keep track of your appointments and important due dates. When you notice your apartment or dorm room is looking messy, clean it up. Don’t blame your teacher or your boss if you’re not doing well in a class or at work. If you make a mistake, own up to it, and try to make it right yourself instead of immediately running back to mom and dad so they can fix it for you. When you come home to visit your parents, don’t fall back into old routines, and let mom do your laundry for you. Parents sacrifice much in taking on not only their own burdens, but the burden of responsibility for each of their children as well. But they should not have to carry more than their own burdens indefinitely; when a child is able, he, in gratitude to the unselfish care he received for many years from his parents, should begin to transfer his load from their shoulders to his, as soon as he possibly can.</p>\n<p>I’ll be honest with you. Taking responsibility for your life isn’t all that fun. It requires doing things that are often boring, tedious, frustrating, and time-consuming. You’ll feel the burden of weighing a hard decision and accepting the consequences, even if they’re not favorable to you. You’ll often go un-praised and un-rewarded for being responsible.</p>\n<p>But taking responsibility for your life <em>is</em> satisfying. You’ll gain a quiet confidence in yourself as you <a href=\"http://artofmanliness.com/2010/02/16/building-your-resiliency-part-iii-taking-control-of-your-life/\">take control of your own life</a>. You’ll feel empowered. Instead of feeling like life is simply happening <em>to</em> you, you’ll begin to feel like the captain of your destiny and master of your soul. As you assume responsibility for your life, you’ll notice doors open up to new and better opportunities. While you may notice that other young men who don’t take responsibility for their lives seem to enjoy a life of worry-free ease, give it a few years: those same men will probably have progressed little and seem stuck in neutral. You can have little responsibility, a ton of fun and pleasure, and few life options, or <a title=\"Freedom From…Freedom To\" href=\"http://artofmanliness.com/2012/02/21/freedom-from-freedom-to/\">a healthy amount of responsibility, a healthy amount of fun and pleasure, and a ton of life options</a>. I personally endorse the latter option. As the video above puts it, while it’s easy to get by by having other people do everything for you, “the trouble is, when you’re not self-reliant, you’ll never do more than just get by.”</p>\n<p><strong>2. Be informed. </strong>Of course in order to take on more responsibilities, you have to know how to carry out those responsibilities. Some young men continue letting mom and dad do things for them, with the excuse that they just don’t know how to do those things themselves. They often turn to their parents to make decisions for them for the same reason. But the truth is, they’ve never actually tried to figure things out on their own.</p>\n<p>This excuse is especially weak in the age of the internet, with answers to many of life’s questions just a Google search away. Need to figure out how to apply for financial aid? Don’t pawn the job off on mom — get on the computer and start researching it yourself.</p>\n<p>This isn’t to say that you should completely avoid mom and dad or other adults for advice and counsel. There are some problems or decisions Google just can’t help with. You should definitely take advantage of the <a title=\"Practical Wisdom: The Master Virtue\" href=\"http://artofmanliness.com/2011/12/19/practical-wisdom/\">practical wisdom</a> older people have acquired by asking for their input when making an important decision or trying to solve a problem.</p>\n<p>However, I’d encourage you <em><strong>not</strong></em> to always make your parents a resource of first resort. We frequently turn to our parents when we don’t really want input — we want to be told what to do. And when parents hear about your problem, they often want to take care of it for you, even when you protest. So investigate yourself first; try figuring things out on your own. Experience can be the best teacher. Once you’ve reached a wall, <em>then</em> go talk to your parents. Because you’ve gotten your hands dirty with your issue, so to speak, you’ll be in a better position to ask them effective questions. Instead of feeling like a kid, you’ll feel more like a fellow traveler in the land of adulthood who’s simply looking for advice from someone who has already been there.</p>\n<p>In situations where the stakes are high, turn to others sooner rather than later; oftentimes it’s better to learn from the mistakes of others, rather than making them yourself. But by always taking at least the first steps of intelligence gathering yourself whenever you can, you’ll grow and make discoveries you wouldn’t have otherwise.</p>\n<p>The self-reliant man is always looking for a chance to learn and expand his knowledge and skills. He reads books for his classes not because he has to, but because he wants to. And whether he’s in college or on the job, he also reads regularly for pleasure. He keeps up with the news and current events. He talks to others and <a title=\"Listen Up!  Part I: Learning the Manly Skill of Paying Attention\" href=\"http://artofmanliness.com/2012/05/02/how-to-listen-effectively/\">really listens to them</a>. He’s very observant wherever he goes. In this way, he builds up a library of information that he can draw upon when making a decision or solving a problem.</p>\n<p><strong>3. Know where you’re going. </strong>A self-reliant man has goals that he has set for <em>himself. </em>His aims are not merely those things other people think he <a href=\"http://artofmanliness.com/2011/01/24/dont-should-all-over-yourself/\"><em>should</em> do.</a>  The self-reliant man is <a title=\"The Autonomous Man in an Other-Directed World\" href=\"http://artofmanliness.com/2012/06/11/becoming-an-autonomous-man-in-an-other-directed-world/\">autonomous</a> and doesn’t overly rely on others to validate his decisions. A self-reliant man works with an end in mind. <a title=\"Craft the Life You Want: Creating a Blueprint for Your Future\" href=\"http://artofmanliness.com/2011/02/08/create-a-life-plan/\">He has created a blueprint for his future. </a>When he runs into a problem, he informs himself on what an ideal resolution would be and then works to make it a reality. He plans out his weeks and ensures tasks that he’s responsible for are completed.</p>\n<p><strong>4. Make your own decisions. </strong>One thing I’ve learned the hard way is that life is actually much easier and a lot less stressful when you proactively make your own decisions.  It’s tempting when you’re younger to simply let life happen to you and hope that decisions and problems will magically resolve themselves. They won’t. In fact, <a title=\"Rip Off the Band-Aid!\" href=\"http://artofmanliness.com/2011/12/04/rip-off-the-band-aid/\">problems and decisions often get bigger and harrier</a> the longer you wait to take action on them. Make <a href=\"http://artofmanliness.com/2009/08/09/being-decisive/\">proactive decision-making</a> a habit. With any choice or problem you may face, decide on an action plan quickly, and execute it immediately.</p>\n<blockquote><p>“In any moment of decision, the best thing you can do is the right thing, the next best thing is the wrong thing, and the worst thing you can do is nothing.” -Theodore Roosevelt</p></blockquote>\n<p>Also, while you should certainly seek advice from others to inform your decisions, don’t rely on them to make your decisions for you. It’s your life. Don’t let others live it for you.</p>\n<h3><strong>Balancing Self-Reliance</strong></h3>\n<p>Learning to be self-reliant takes time; you’re not magically transformed into a sage, totally autonomous adult the moment you turn 18. Rather, self-reliance is something you develop in stages as you get older, learn from experience, and become more and more independent.</p>\n<p>I often get questions from readers like, “When my parents come and visit, is it okay for them to buy me groceries?” “Is it okay for them to pay for my rent?” These men want to know where a young man should draw the line in being self-reliant and receiving assistance from their parents. Unfortunately, I don’t have any easy answers for such queries, and I don’t think there are any hard and fast rules either. I would recommend asking yourself this question: “Will this support lead to more independence down the road or will it lead to greater dependence?”  For example, a <a href=\"https://springerlink3.metapress.com/content/j663834230h60ht2/resource-secured/?target=fulltext.pdf&amp;sid=atfqemgvgf5pymlnz1jxuhty&amp;sh=www.springerlink.com\">recent study </a>showed that college students who get less financial support from their parents think of themselves as adults sooner, drink less, and may be more career-oriented, while those whose parents give them a free ride are more likely to engage in risky behaviors like binge drinking, and may be less motivated in their studies. But students with parents who provide <em>no</em> assistance, are more likely to take longer to graduate and drop out altogether. Basically, what the study found was that either too much self-reliance or too little can lead to a compromised college career, and less independence in the future; thus, the authors of that study recommended a balanced approach in which parents provide some assistance, while the student is responsible for other expenses. All of which is to say, it’s best to grow into self-reliance in stages — concentrate on becoming self-reliant in whatever you can, wherever you’re at in life, in ways that don’t compromise your ability to gain more independence in later stages.</p>\n<p><em><strong> Have any other tips on developing a self-reliant mentality?

Or at least it would have been before you discovered this incredibly useful\nMadlibs-style template, which will shave your speech preparation down from a couple of\nweeks to 10 minutes.</em><em>For your speech to be truly perfect, however, you\nmust respect these two rules as you feel in the blanks:</em><em>1. Maintain\nthe right emotional balance. The perfect best man's speech makes the audience laugh at the\nbeginning and cry at the end. Don't get too emotional too quickly, or they will snicker at\nyou.</em><em>2. Keep your anecdotes accessible. There is nothing worse than a\nspeech that only the best man and groom can understand. Your jokes should feel like inside\njokes to as much of the room as possible.</em>\n<h3>The Universally Perfect Best Man&#39;s Speech </h3>\nGood evening, everyone. Thanks for putting down your forks for long enough to give me\nyour undivided attention. For those of you who don’t know who I am, I’m the\nbest man. And before I say anything else, I’d like us all to take a moment to\nappreciate and raise our glasses to<strong> [<em>names of parents who paid, starting with\nmom</em>]</strong> for what has been thus far a wonderful celebration on such a special\noccasion. Now, I know that most of you don’t make it out often and only came here\nfor the free <strong>[<em>main course -- probably chicken</em>]</strong>, so I’ve\nbeen asked by <strong>[<em>bride’s name</em>]</strong> to instruct you not to make a\nscene -- I’m looking at you <strong>[<em>troublesome uncle or youngest child in\nattendance</em>]</strong>.I first met\n<strong>[</strong><em><strong>groom’s name</strong></em><strong>]</strong> at\n<strong>[<em>authentic first meeting occasion</em>]</strong>, but I really got to know him\nat<strong> [<em>another early meeting that supports coming anecdote</em>]</strong>.Don’t worry, <strong>[<em>bride’s name</em>]</strong>. I’m not\nleading to the story you’re worried about!So when I first saw\n<strong>[<em>groom’s name</em>]</strong> at <strong>[<em>early meeting that supports\ncoming anecdote</em>]</strong>, I couldn’t believe that he was <strong>[<em>weird\nbehavior that at least 80% of room will recognize</em>]</strong>. Now, I know they say\nthat you never get a second chance to make a first impression, but let’s just say\nthat<strong> [<em>groom’s name</em>]</strong> should be grateful that that’s\njust a myth!<strong>[<em>Groom</em>]</strong> stopped doing\n<strong>[<em>aforementioned weird behavior</em>]</strong> not long after that meeting,\nbut, happily, he didn’t lose his <strong>[<em>positive personality trait driving\nweird behavior</em>]</strong>. And for anyone who doubted that he did, let’s not\nforget about our night at <strong>[<em>bachelor party venue</em>]</strong>… Just\nkidding, <strong>[<em>bride’s name</em>]</strong>. <strong>[<em>Groom’s\nname</em>]</strong> was as well behaved… ahem, dull… as<strong>\n[<em>grumpiest person in attendance</em>]</strong>.But there’s a lot\nmore to being<strong> [<em>positive personality trait driving weird\nbehavior</em>]</strong> than <strong>[<em>aforementioned weird behavior</em>]</strong>.\nWe’ve all seen<strong> [<em>groom’s name</em>]</strong> bring his<strong>\n[<em>positive personality trait</em>]</strong> to his work as a<strong> [<em>groom’s\nprofession</em>]</strong> and to his pursuit of <strong>[<em>universally recognized hobby\nor pastime</em>]</strong>. And it’s definitely been a driving force in a friendship\nthat has lasted <strong>[<em>length of time of friendship</em>]</strong>, with a lot of\nyears yet to come.And, in any case, we all knew that\n<strong>[<em>aforementioned weird behavior</em>]</strong> wouldn’t last forever. (At\nleast we all hoped it wouldn’t!) If it had, then<strong> [<em>bride’s\nname</em>]</strong> probably wouldn’t have given <strong>[<em>groom’s\nname</em>]</strong> a second look at <strong>[<em>venue of their first\nmeeting</em>]</strong>, where they first met. Walking into<strong> [<em>venue of their\nfirst meeting</em>]</strong>, I’m sure neither <strong>[<em>groom’s\nname</em>]</strong> nor <strong>[<em>bride’s name</em>]</strong> expected it to be\nthe start of a journey that would lead us here today. After all,\n<strong>[<em>bride’s name</em>]</strong> was so busy with her<strong> [<em>estimable\noccupation/hobby/passion of that time</em>]</strong>, while <strong>[<em>groom’s\nname</em>]</strong> was so busy with his <strong>[<em>ridiculous/juvenile\nhobby</em>]</strong>, that neither thought that they had room for another person in their\nlife. On<strong> [<em>approximate date of first meeting</em>]</strong>,\ndestiny changed their plans.And this was the first of many changes to come in\n<strong>[<em>groom’s name</em>]</strong>’s life. First of all, gone were his\n<strong>[<em>bad lifestyle habit</em>]</strong> and his <strong>[<em>bad fashion\ntrademark</em>]</strong>! But, more importantly, we started to see\n<strong>[<em>groom’s name</em>]</strong> shine in ways we never knew possible.\n<strong>[<em>Bride’s name</em>]</strong>, whether it was through her\n<strong>[<em>positive personality trait</em>]</strong> or her introducing<strong>\n[<em>groom’s name</em>]</strong> to<strong> [<em>positive group\nactivity</em>]</strong>, brought a new dimension of happiness to him that even I had never\nseen. But, having got to know <strong>[<em>bride’s name</em>]</strong>’s\nfamily a bit more in recent weeks, now I understand where this happiness comes from.In fact, tonight I see two very happy families coming together. And we all know\nhow delicate interfamilial relations can be -- particularly when one family is<strong>\n[<em>nationality or religious denomination of groom’s family</em>]</strong> and the\nother is <strong>[<em>nationality or religious denomination of bride’s\nfamily</em>]</strong>. But whether it’s over a steaming plate of<strong>\n[<em>traditional meal associated with nationality of one group</em>]</strong> or getting\ntogether around the <strong>[<em>icon associated with religious denomination of other\ngroup</em>]</strong>, it all comes down the same thing: love and mutual respect. And I\nthink you would all agree that there’s a lot of that in this room today, and I think\nyou’d also agree that there’s a lot of that between<strong> [<em>groom’s\nname</em>]</strong> and <strong>[<em>bride’s name</em>]</strong>. So\nlet’s all raise our glasses to the happy couple.<strong> [<em>Groom’s\nname</em>]</strong> may not <strong>[<em>aforementioned weird behavior</em>]</strong>\nanymore, but with<strong> [<em>bride’s name</em>]</strong> at his side, his\n<strong>[<em>positive personality trait driving weird behavior</em>]</strong> is now\nperfectly matched. Cheers!                <p>\n                    <a href=\"http://www.askmen.com/money/how_to/best-man-speech.html\">Continue Reading</a>\n                </p>"

Try these 10 tools to give yourself a productivity boost.</p><p style=\"text-align:left\">I don't know about you, but I can't function without having a lot on my plate. I'm one of those 'work-well-under-pressure' type of entrepreneur.</p><p>One thing that I can&#39;t stand is repetitive tasks; tasks that could and should be automated. I always look for ways to improve my productivity – if I can shave five minutes off something I do every day that adds up to a huge ROI.</p><p>Here are 10 tools that help do just that:</p>1. <a href=\"http://www.activeinboxhq.com/\">ActiveInbox</a><p>If you, like most people, use Gmail or Google Apps as your email interface, this plugin is a must have.</p><p>I have read every variation of Getting Things Done (GTD) there is. From articles to books, I try to live by the general principles of the teachings. In a nutshell, your goal is to organize your to-do list. If you&#39;re like me, most of your to-dos exist within your email – so why not turn your email into a GTD system? ActiveInbox does just that by letting you categorize tasks: Action Items, Waiting On, Someday Tasks. The rest of the GTD principles become a layer within your Gmail account. The utility can range from basic principles that take 15 minutes to advanced methodologies for the super-organized. I don&#39;t use any other to-do system. ActiveInbox is it. Additionally, the simplest way to add a personal to-do, like to pick up groceries, is to send an email to yourself!</p>2. <a href=\"http://glympse.com/\">Glympse</a><p>When you're on the go, it can get hectic trying to let different people know where you're at or when you'll be there. Glympse is a mobile app that allows you to share where you are, with whomever you like, and quickly (without signing in or requiring the other user to have an app or even a phone).</p><p>Unlike Google Latitude or other location sharing apps, Glympse only shares your location around a specific time interval. In fact, it can even stop sharing automatically when you get to your location. Going to a scheduled meeting? With one button it sends an email or text to your scheduled meeting attendees. When they click that link, a simple Google map opens with your location, how fast you're going, and approximately when you'll get there. It's the ultimate response to \"where are you?\"</p>3. <a href=\"http://www.swype.com/\">Swype</a><p>Swype is a record-breaking solution to typing—swiping is more accurate—on your touchscreen smart phone. It comes from the same group that made T9 (remember how we used to text on a number pad?). After a couple weeks of using it, you&#39;ll never want go back to a regular keyword.</p><p>Instead of touching each letter to type, you just drag your finger from letter to letter. It's known to let users type around 40 words per minute on their mobile phones.</p>4. <a href=\"http://www.tungle.me/Home/\">Tungle</a><a href=\"http://www.tungle.me/Home/\">.</a><a href=\"http://www.tungle.me/Home/\">me</a><p>End the back and forth of trying to settle on one meeting time that works for a whole group of people. With Tungle.me, however, everyone can easily see your availability (or unavailability) and select options for the time and duration of each meeting. It also incorporates e-calendars from Google, Outlook, iCal, and many others to make scheduling meetings much more efficient and streamlined.</p>5. <a href=\"http://bufferapp.com/\">Buffer</a><p>To build my personal brand through social media, I make sure I have relevant and consistent content to share. I don't have much time to post what I find for each account, so I use Buffer to do it for me. Buffer will automatically queue content that I select and post it at the time I choose. It's pretty handy for when I find something interesting through aimless browsing. To make the most of this tool, I've integrated it with <a href=\"http://www.socialbro.com/\">SocialBro</a>, which scans my Twitter followers to tell me when the majority of them are reading my tweets. That way, I can make the most of every tweet I send out and know I'm reaching out in the best way possible.</p>6. <a href=\"http://www.skype.com/intl/en-us/home?intcmp=wlogo\">Skype</a><p>Skype is hands down the best free video-chat software available. Almost everyone in a business setting uses it, making it the preeminent place to connect with coworkers and colleagues instantly. I don't have to wait to know when someone is available, as Skype will let you know when they're online, offline, or currently away. Either way, through Skype I can get a message through quickly and know it's been received.</p><p>The best part about Skype is that it has both free and premium accounts available. You have plenty of options to contact someone by instant message, or by calling (just voice or with video). Skype is also available for free on Android, iPhone, and iPad, allowing video calls and IM over 3G or WiFi.</p>7. <a href=\"http://writethat.name/new/en/index.html\">Writethat</a><a href=\"http://writethat.name/new/en/index.html\">.</a><a href=\"http://writethat.name/new/en/index.html\">name</a><p>Keeping track of all the new names when I'm networking is exhausting. Usually when I tell people to email me, it's because WriteThat.Name will help me to get their information organized and saved. This tool uses the information from the signatures of emails to sort and archive contacts automatically. It operates on cloud architecture, so it only requires your email to use the service. I've saved hours of tedious updating through this tool by purchasing a daily merge of information for only $3 a month, but a free version will do the same once a month.</p>8. <a href=\"http://unroll.me/\">Unroll</a><a href=\"http://unroll.me/\">.</a><a href=\"http://unroll.me/\">me</a><p>A cluttered inbox is a cluttered mind. I easily get distracted from sorting my inbox of junk emails and unsubscribing from lists, all of which don't interest me in the first place. Luckily, Unroll.me helps to cut time and distraction by allowing me to mass unsubscribe from lists, and organize the emails I do receive into one single email.</p>9. <a href=\"http://www.google.com/url?q=http%3A%2F%2Fimgur.com&amp;sa=D&amp;sntz=1&amp;usg=AFQjCNFmC_NbfOClecsTO1uihJKuZYVIFw\">Imgur</a><p>When I have to share an image and do it quickly, I always end up going straight to Imgur. Imgur is a free image hosting site that requires no sign in. What's even better is that the link can be used in emails, IMs, and through social media.</p>10. <a href=\"http://www.google.com/url?q=http%3A%2F%2Fwikisend.com&amp;sa=D&amp;sntz=1&amp;usg=AFQjCNFhFNHLeG1YXhk8nTHflS_UZQzCdw\">Wikisend</a><p>Wikisend is like Imgur—but for sending files. With no login required, you can upload and share files up to 100MB. It cuts the time and hassle of sending files through email and downloading them, only to find you need to update your software or the file is corrupted.</p><p>When looking to maximize my time, I try to examine the details rather than the big processes, for that is where you have the most opportunity to become more efficient. Maybe you'll spend five minutes per task without these tools, but in the course of a day, that's an hour a day lost. Doing the math into what that can be in weeks or months should be enough motivation to make a change in your daily routine.</p>"

Similar to past EDCs held at the Los Angeles Coliseum, EDC NYC will be taking over the stadium and surrounding parking lots with 4 stages and countless carnival rides.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.elektrodaily.com/featured/2012/04/elektro-exclusive-never-before-seen-image-of-edc-ny-the-whole-layout/\">Via: Elektro Daily</a></p>\n<p><strong>Update:</strong> We’ve just been informed by Insomniac and Pacha NYC that the event layout is not yet finalized, so we’ve removed the image for the time being. We’ll keep you updated.</p>\n<img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/DancingAstronaut/~4/KQNNypLxr8E\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\">"

We know because you are in first class that you are more than likely a regular customer and a frequent flier, and we are grateful for your business.</p><p>We also know that although you make up only 5% of our total flying customers, you comprise 85% of our complaints. We believe that is in part because you appreciate the value of our relationship and want to help us be better.</p><p>So, although your safety is our primary concern, your comfort is very important to us. I would ask that you help us to be better by telling any of our flight attendants before, during or after this flight if there is anything we can do to make your trip better. Also, after we have landed, if there is anything that I can do, please let me know, I’ll be here at the front to thank you as you exit.</p><p>Of course, if there is still a concern that has been unaddressed or a comment you would like to make, please fill out our customer feedback form in the seat pocket or go on-line. Welcome aboard and please enjoy your flight.</p><p>I travel a lot and sometimes even get bumped up to first class, but I  have never heard a speech like this before. Candidly, it was surprising to  me–and from my angle, it seemed that members of that cabin were a little  surprised too.</p><p>It felt unforced, friendly, and sincere. My responses were:</p><ul><li>“I think that this is going to be a good flight and we’ll be taken care of.”</li><li>“This captain and his team want my business and want me happy.”</li><li>“If there is an issue, I’ll let them know on this flight, rather than send an angry email or fill out a comment card. That will probably take care of things.”</li></ul>Is No News Really Good?<p>It is easy to assume that if you do not hear anything, things are probably good. However, people can be silent out of either a timid disposition or a “get-along” culture. They may even think that they are being respectful by keeping things to themselves.</p><p>Recently I was speaking with a client who told me that one of my video programs had caused a lot of discussions and some disagreements on how to handle a scenario I described in the video. His question to his team was, “Did anybody call Tom and ask him?” The answer was no.</p><p>I was really surprised. This is a group with whom I have a great relationship and regular conversation, yet, no one told me of their issue.</p>Asking for Feedback<p>It is not enough to have feedback mechanisms in place, an open door policy or a well-trained customer service staff. If you want to keep customers happy and grow loyalty, you need to solicit feedback actively from your customers. I think that the example from the pilot is a good example.</p><p>For myself, I have a meeting in a couple of weeks with my client’s staff and I am going to open up the feedback conversation. As the leader of my client company said: “Tom, we want you to get better. It is no favor or friendship to you to not tell you what will make you better. But, we are sometimes a little reserved, so you will have to encourage us.”</p><p>Great feedback. Great client.</p>"
